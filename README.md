## To do:

    * Work out image meta data (such as width, height, any geo location, etc) and write this to the /_data folder
* Layouts for
    * 365 listing
    * 365 entry
    * diary listing
    * diary entry
    * gallery listing
    * gallery entry
* questions that demand answers
    * Should I merge 365 into diary? or rename 365 to something more generic?
    * Is rake the best automator? Grunt?
    * What other minifiers/gzip should I use
    * robots.txt needs creating
    * Where to store / backup images
    * how to deploy.
    * can I have one process that builds my less and jekyll in order? or whats the best way to do this?
    * why does jekyll randomly process X files? And take random times to do so?
