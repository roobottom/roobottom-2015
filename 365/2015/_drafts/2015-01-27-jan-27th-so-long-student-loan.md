I had a pleasant surprise today when I called the Student Loans Company to switch my payments. "I'm pleased to tell you that you've paid off your loan in full" said the friendly Scottish chappie. "In fact, you've made an overpayment, but don't worry, just write us a letter explaining and we'll give you a refund."
