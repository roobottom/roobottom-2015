Katie picked me up from the station and I was excited. The sky was clear, perfect for star trails. Like a child I quickly ate my dinner and rushed out of the door. I was immediately disappointed. The clear skies were full of clouds. 

I went down to the beach anyway on the off chance the clouds would clear. No such luck. Crestfallen I headed home where, typically, the skies were crystal clear again. Oh well, I'll try again another night. Meanwhile I snapped this below average light trail with a torch.
