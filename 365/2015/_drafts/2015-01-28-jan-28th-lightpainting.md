I'm not sure I remember a moment when I've switch from being merely interested in something to being actually excited by it; but today I think that exact thing happened. Doing a random search for "light painting" I found the unbelievable work of [Darren Pearson](https://twitter.com/dariustwin) and suddenly realised what is possible with this exciting art-form. 

I took a couple of long-exposures this evening when I got home. I quite like them, but they're not neatly good enough... Yet.
