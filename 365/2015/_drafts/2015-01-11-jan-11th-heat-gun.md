Still reeling from yesterday's failure, _the saga of the sticky floor_ continued today. I wasn't being beaten that easily, so broke out the heat gun. "No surrender!" I yelled as I blasted the glue with the 1200W monster. The glue, unfazed, remained as sticky as ever. Still, as failures go at least today was kind-of fun — at least twice as fun as vibrating your arm off with an underpowered sander.
