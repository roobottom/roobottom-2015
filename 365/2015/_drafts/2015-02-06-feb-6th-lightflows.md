My long suffering, pregnant wife once again put up with my whims and graciously agreed to pose for yet another light painting photograph. This time I set up my tripod on the stairs and framed her on the living-room floor. Lit by one sweet-wrapper covered torch, I used red, green and blue lasers to paint lines over her. I'm pretty pleased with the effect.

Later in the evening we Skype'd with Gareth who's on the Spanish border, working a season at a ski resort. They've had almost a metre of snow, and I'm extremely jealous — although not so jealous of the -20°C temperates.
