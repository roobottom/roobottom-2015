Some may just say I was getting a bit desperate with this photo, but when you've had a busy day in the London office and have forgotten to take a photo anything will do...

Anyway, I was pretty hungry this evening so made what some describe as the "vegetarians wet dream". The humble omelet elevated to perfection with the addition of some potato, olives, mushrooms and red pepper.
