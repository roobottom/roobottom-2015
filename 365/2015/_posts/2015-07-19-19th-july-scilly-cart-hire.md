Our last full day on Scilly, but oh what a day! No trip to the Islands would be complete without hiring a golf cart and careering around the very few miles of road like crazed fools. I also finally got to use the wetsuit and snorkel gear I'd made Cath and Dave bring all the way from home when we spent a few hours on the beach. The strong smell of rotting sea-weed didn't seem to bother Baby Roo who also enjoyed a quick dip.

For lunch we ate at the excellent [Kaffeehaus](http://www.scillyguesthouse.co.uk/kaffeehaus) where tradional German pretzels and cake were the order of the day.

Later we had a pint or two (or three) in the Atlantic before Cath and Dave kindly babysat so Katie and I could watch a romantic sunset on what I dubbed "Lifeboat Rock". 

All in all a good day.
