An unexpected glorious day! What a treat. We got up late (thanks Baby Roo!) and pottered around for a while. Then (of course) we headed to Tregarthen's for ale and a game of Scheiße Kopf. In the afternoon I firmly established the rock above the RNLI station as my new favorite place on Scilly. What a view! Later, Dave and Cath headed off for dinner at Star Castle, so Katie and I (having successfully put Baby Roo to bed) cooked a creamy pasta meal and played a few games in the courtyard of our flat.
