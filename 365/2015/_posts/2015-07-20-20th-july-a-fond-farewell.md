On our last day I was feeling the effects of last night's beer and Baby Roo induced sleep loss, so it was a heavy heart we awoke to find the Islands yet again covered in a thick layer of fog. What else to do but head to our favorite destination and enjoy a lunch at Tregarthens. I had a few last walks along the Garrison before we boarded the boat for Penzance. 

But, Oh! What a difference a bit of sunshine makes! This was the smoothest crossing I've ever experienced on the Scillonian and Baby Roo attracted quite the fan club of elderly day-trippers — Who by all accounts had generally enjoyed the islands, aside from one couple who thought that "there weren't enough shops".
