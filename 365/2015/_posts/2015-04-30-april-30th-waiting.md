What a week. Poor Katie has hardly slept as labour pains have kept her awake every night since last Saturday. Finally, baby Roo is showing signs that s/he might arrive soon. My wife is a trooper, I'm absolutely in awe of the way she's dealt with what's probably the most demanding week of our lives.
