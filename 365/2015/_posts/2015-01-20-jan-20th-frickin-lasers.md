I continued the  light painting theme today by cutting out a copy of the _roo_ logo from an old Oxford Black & Red notebook cover and blu-tacking it to the wall in my office. I tried lighting it with fairy lights, torches and Electroluminescent Wire. Nothing was working until I broke out a couple of laser pointers and the talcum powder, et voila, a half-decent light painting.
