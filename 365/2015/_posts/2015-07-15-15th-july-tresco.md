At last some good weather! We took the lunchtime boat over to Tresco, and immediately set about finding somewhere to eat. We had intended to visit the gardens, but by the time we'd done eating, drinking Korev and playing Scrabble Sack, it was time for the boat home. Later, Dave and I did some light painting on the beach.
