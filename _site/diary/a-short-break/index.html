            <p>I’m taking a short break from writing. I’m just feeling particularly uninspired at the moment, and anything I could bring you would just be for the sake of, and sub-standard. I’ll still be adding photos and live links so keep an eye on them. Thanks for every one’s support and comments over the last year or so, It’s made it all worth it. Here’s hoping I’ll be able to restore usual service ASAP. Jon Roobottom.</p>
