            <p>On 25 July, 1976 Viking Orbiter 1 was surveying the Cydonia region of Mars when it took what in now perhaps the most famous image of the red planet, the infamous face on Mars. This shocking photograph led some people to claim that there must have been an ancient civilisation on Mars thousands of years ago, and it was these people who built the face. I have always had a fascination with this photograph, what could it possibly mean? Then, last night I was looking through my telescope when I made a discovery that can only be described as a seminal moment in the history of man. Another face, staring back at me. It appeared blury at first, but as my eyes grew accustomed, I was able to pick out more detail. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything more astounding or beautiful in my life. I believe this photograph proves without a shadow of a doubt that there was indeed life on Mars thousands of years ago. I have obviously enhanced this photo somewhat to enable you to clearly see the lines of the face (this can be hard for the untrained eye), even so I think you will agree this is compelling evidence. I have contacted nasa with this most starling picture, but remember you heard it here first! We are not alone. ( note, photos removed due to compatability issues. So it’s a bit of a sh*t post now to be honest. )</p>
