            <p>Today I was reminded again of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2013&amp;version=31">1 Corinthians 13</a>, verses 4 - 7 especially.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It never says it’s easy, never an instant happily ever after, but always striving. Christian or not, I hope that these words are universally true. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/19018310@N00/100659113/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/32/100659113_007609ffca.jpg" alt="1 Corinthians 13" /></a><small>Photograph by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/19018310@N00/100659113/">CookieChick079</a></small></p>
