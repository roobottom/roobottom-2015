            <p>Thanks to Si for <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/2006/05/08/what-do-you-people-want-from-me/#comment-1289">his suggestion</a> for what to write about next, I bring you the Multipack Logo design walkthrough, thingy… <img src="http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/multipack.png" alt="The Final Multipack Logo" /> The final logo is an amalgamation of an several different logo’s and ideas from the multipackers. The original idea for the circular theme came from <a href="http://www.multipack.co.uk/members/simon-jobling/">Si</a> who was thinking along the lines of the circles representing a pack of something, it also worked as a representation of system, all the parts working together for one common goal. <img src="http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/cicle_ideas.png" alt="Multipack Circle Concepts" /> This, thought Chris, is a good idea but it needs to more personal. So was born the concept of the faces. The circular theme would fit perfectly with the face idea (as, you know, faces are round). Taking the whole lot into Fireworks, I mocked up several of the founding multipackers as simple vector faces; using beards, glasses and funky hair-dos to differentiate between the people. Several concepts later and wham-bam-thank-you… erm… Yeah, well, we all decided on a logo we could work with. Here then are several of the early ideas. Enjoy. Oh, and that font you ask? Why, It’s everyone’s favorite <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=201619&amp;grab_id=0&amp;page_id=5874&amp;query=VAG&amp;SCOPE=Fonts">VAG Rounded</a>. <img src="http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/concepts.png" alt="Concepts that lead to the final Multipack Logo" /></p>
