            <p>I was always skeptical about earning money through affliate links and online advertising, but for the past year I’ve been using a service called <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/?ref=15374">Text Link Ads</a> and been very Impressed with the results. Last month I earned a total of $112 from selling adverts from this site and others - I never imagined that I could make that much! TLA is cool, and if you’re looking to advertise, they even do a <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/starter_kit.php?ref=15374">$100 free</a> start up promotion. Get In! Has anyone else had any experience with this?</p>
