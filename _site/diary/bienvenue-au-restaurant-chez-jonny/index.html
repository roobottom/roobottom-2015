      <td>Monday Nights is French class night! Usually my homework effort is pretty poor, but when we were asked to design a menu for a restaurant of our choice, and we weren’t particularly busy in the office, well I kind of spent perhaps a <em>little</em> too much time on it. <img src="http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/jonnys_resturantthumb.png" alt="Jonnys Restaurant" /> So if this were a real restaurant not only would it have the same address as the <a href="http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1059132502966">British Consulate in Paris</a> but (as you would expect for a quality eating establishment) it would be very pricey. Anyway, that’s all I’ve got to say on the subject, if you’re looking for some quality French cuisine, you may want to try <a href="http://www.lebelcanto.com/">Belcanto</a> who for some reason have strangely similar menu’s to Jonny’s, but with the added advantage that they’re a real restaurant, oh, and opera singers will bring you your food. Boop. Oh, and a big big thanks to <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/inc/livelinks.go.php?url=http://www.wibsite.com/wiblog/daughteroftheking/">Minn</a> who provided some of the translation. <a href="http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/jonnys_resturant.png">Front</a></td>
