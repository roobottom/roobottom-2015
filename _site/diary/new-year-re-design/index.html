And as regular visitors will know (guess this mean <a href="http://www.lloydyweb.org" title="Llloydyweb">Paul</a>) things are looking a bit different. But, with any live re-design, it’s a messy business. So this is where this post comes in. I need to test that my css’ll cover a multitude of posting sins. Feel free to ignor the next bit… Sometimes we want make things <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em>. Other times i’ll have said something then want to <strike>cross it out</strike>. - This is a list
- It’s not orderd
- But that’s cool</p>

<ol>
  <li>This is another list</li>
  <li>And this one is orderd</li>
  <li>Rockin or what!</li>
</ol>

  <p>This is a blockquote</p>

<p>And that’s about it I think! Enjoy.</p>
