            <p>In an attempt to cut living cost I’m trying to sell my car, it just drinks petrol. So yesterday I got it valued on the “wonderful” <a href="http://www.glass.co.uk/uk/en/">Glass’s Motoring Guide Website.</a> Glass’s bill themselves as</p>

<p>Well, you’d think they’d have some money to spend on a decent website then wouldn’t you? Nonetheless, I forged ahead, and entered all my details, and duly paid the £2.99 using my switch card. Pressing the submit button, I sat back to wait for my valuation to instantly pop up on the screen. And I waited. Then waited some more. When it became clear that they’d taken my money and ran, I click on the “contact us” link, hoping to find a telephone number so I could call them and politely ask them what happened. But no, only an address and a feedback form greeted me. 7 hours later I received a reply, which said… &gt; Dear Jon Thank you for your e-mail. Please may we have a few more details to help us locate your valuation. Information requested - MAKE MODEL ENGINE SIZE MILEAGE DOORS</p>

<p>Within seconds I’d sent them this information. And I waited. And then waited some more. (this seems to be a recurring theme with them). So as it stands at the moment they’ve stolen £2.99 from me. Brilliant! So my recommendation? NEVER use this website, in fact use their fine <a href="http://www.parkers.co.uk/pricing/">competors</a>, they’re sure NOT to rip you off!</p>
