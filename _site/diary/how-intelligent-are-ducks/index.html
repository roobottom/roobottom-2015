            <p>Just a <em>quack</em> question (sorry)… Just how intelligent are ducks? There is some logic behind my thinking on this one… This morning on my way to work (yes, late again) I was forced to stop as a family of ducks used the pedestrian crossing. “This is surreal” I thought. It was the sort of thing you see on those horrible posters that people have, you know the type with a cat hanging onto a branch and the catch-line underneath says “Hang On”. That type. So this got me thinking, if a duck is clever enough to know to use the crossing point, what else could a duck do? Obviously the lack of opposable thumbs (and indeed hands) rules out world domination, but surly a civil service job wouldn’t be out of the question? In fact, we could see a duck in political office soon, or even becoming the leader of a smaller nation with a large duck population who are politically motivated towards the duck issues of the day. You never know, maybe you’ve already met the next duck into space. I’ve heard there’s a secret training facility just outside of Bloxwich where duck-assassins are trained to get one back for all the ducks that have become the filling for crispy pancakes. I love crispy pancakes… I’m probably in real trouble.</p>
