Besides my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rugbymadgirl/301979049/">random drivel</a> about the history of my name, there were some pretty interesting answers to the question of the evening: Where Am I? Some that stuck out for me were… <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rugbymadgirl/301979092/in/photostream/">Diego and his trumpet playing fairy</a>; <a href="http://www.acerbia.com/">David Frew’s</a> 2 minute speed read of no less than two sides of A4 of his prose. Not only a cleaver chap but a thoroughly nice bloke; <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve Marshall’s</a> answer which saw the entire audience standing up and sitting down on cue thanks to a cleverly written presentation. So, cheers to Kevin and the rest of the guys who put on a superb event which was enjoyed by every single last person in the room - and probably warmed the lives of those around just by it’s pure existence. Oh, and you can find the original image used in this post <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agsystems/301718041/in/pool-20x2/">here</a>… Thanks to agsystems, cos some di*k didn’t take his camera. Oh, and the flickr pool <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/20x2/pool/">here</a>.</p>
