            <p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/">our church</a> started a 28 day period of prayer and fasting. Not that all of us will be fasting food the whole 28 days, but it’s a time of giving things up that we would normally enjoy as a sign that we’re serious about hearing God in this time. For example, one guy in the church is giving up sport for February, because he knows he has to put God first, before his passionate love of watching and playing sports. Yes, even though <a href="http://www.rfu.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/fix.IntFixtures/PoolID/181">England are playing Wales</a>. So why is this so important to us? Well, maybe I should ask another question as I can only give you this from my point of view: Why is this so important to me? The answer is simple, I just want to get closer to God, have him guide me as to where I’m going in this merry-go-round we call life this year. I have questions to ask, and people are always telling me to invest serious prayer time, so that’s what I’m intending to do. As a church were hoping to see some real movement on things like long term sickness and our work in Coalpool to shift up a gear. We should be people on the move, living the adventure that God has set out for us. Please don’t expect me to be somber, or change my writing for the next month. I’ll still post the same amount of faith, personal and random crap as ever. I just wanted to share this with you, as I don’t always talk about my life as a Christian, and somehow find it easier to write. I don’t even know if this stuff gets read. OK, maybe that’s not entirely true I know it gets read by my friends, but comments from strangers who have taken the time to read my stuff are always very much appreciated, even if they are to argue with me.</p>
