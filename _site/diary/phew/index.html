            <p>Last night I got in rather late and tiered from driving the 200 miles back from Katie’s gaf ‘daan sarf’. Before going to bed, I decided to check my email. Amongst the 1000’s of mail from fans and such, nestled one from ebay informing me that I had a new message from another member. Blurry eyed, I clicked on the link and proceeded to enter my username and password. Ok, I admit it, this was universally stupid. I didn’t actually think any more of this until today, when I got two emails that actually were from ebay confirming my new listings of a couple of shiny brand new power mac G5’s. “Oh *****” I thought. Luckily the very nice customer care people sorted it all out for me, and I’ve changed ALL my passwords on everything so those nasty people can’t pull another fast one. Just shows, you can never be too careful.</p>
