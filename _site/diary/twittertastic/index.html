I sit in front of my laptop drawing pretty pictures, writing code and hacking through more <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> than you could shake a stick at. I am, by all accounts, a geek. I even gave that last instance of “CSS” an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_abbr.asp">abbreviation tag</a>, and even worse linked the words “abbreviation tag” to the w3schools article on the subject so the reader, if so inclined, could find out more. Yes, I’m “into” the web big time. I do it for a job, think about it when I’m out, and the other night I had this dream about this giant mouse trying to kill me… But that’s another story. There’s a few things that people like me, erm, like (bad English not withstanding). They are <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>. Granted there are a LOT more, but for the purposes of this post - they’re the only web services that exist, got it? So I’m feeling like I want to update all my “friends” (God forbid that I actually have people I talk to in real like, no that <em>would</em> be scary). I’m particularly enjoying a cup of tea perhaps, or have <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2440369303/">smashed my car into yet another wall</a>. Only, I can’t be bothered to Twitter it, update my skype status AND do my little “Jon Roobottom is…” thing on farsebook. That’s where two magic apps come to your rescue. The first is <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. This cool little (Mac only) app not only shows you your friends twitters and allows you to twitter until you fall off your chair with excitement, it also updates your skype status for you! Sweet. One down, one to go. So jump on Facebook and find an app called “TwitterSync” - add this bad boy, and it’ll update your status based on your last Twitter! Awesome. Follow these two simple instructions, and pretty soon you’ll be having your twitters sh*t out all over the net. Result.</p>
