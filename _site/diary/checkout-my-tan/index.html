            <p>Okay, maybe not a tan but you can certainly see the sun-burn line on my neck thanks to a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/228252033/">groovy new haircut</a>. What a week I’ve had in sunny (aka drizzly) Littlehampton, home of my No.1 lady-fan who also took a few well earned days off work. So back at work again and last week feels a million miles away. This coupled with the impending winter and uncertainty about my future finds me in a melancholy mood this morning readers. Where oh where has our summer gone? Only a few weeks ago we were set for another heat-wave, and now we’re facing the arse end of August and hurtling towards colder weather faster than a greased-up fat man on a steep hill. Perhaps it’s also because I’m moving out of <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/2006/03/13/theres-something-about-walsall/">my house</a> that I’ve been in for six months this weekend. Admittedly I haven’t been there much, but I enjoyed my time at Drayman Close. So all this leaves me feeling like I’m hanging on my the skin of my teeth, waiting for this storm to pass and coming to the realisation that I have no-one to blame but myself. Maybe it’s post holiday blues, but I suspect that’s just a contributing factor. I’ve felt God in all of this, I <em>have</em> had people I didn’t expect shore me up at times, and for that I’m very thankful. So where now? What now? I guess I’ll just have to find out…</p>
