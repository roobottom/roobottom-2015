            <p><a href="http://lloydyweb.com">Paul Lloyd</a> and I went to school together. We laughed and cried together. We shared chips from the same paper bag. But alas, he is not keen on the new design. I don’t know if we can weather this rift in our friendship. As an attempt to repair broken prides and clear the air I would like to publicly discuss the issues my friend Mr. Lloyd has with my design. But first, a brief history. As already mentioned, myself and Paul went to the same fine <a href="http://www.brownhills.walsall.sch.uk/">secondary education establishment</a>. After a teary goodbye, we both left for our respective Universities - Paul choosing a course in Graphic Design and myself a stint in Multimedia Design. After completing our eduction (both with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#Undergraduate_degree_honours_slang">Atilla</a>) we moved into jobs, greasing our way up the ranks to reach the lofty heights of Lead Design at <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> and Interaction Designer at <a href="http://glaxstar.com">Glaxstar</a>. It should be mentioned at this point that whereas I have always had slightly more technical skill than Paul, he far outstrips me on the design front. That said, lets now move onto what he thought of the new design. &gt; F*****G Stars!</p>

<p>Were the first words out of Paul’s mouth. Too many stars apparently. I gathered from this that Paul was less than impressed with the new design. He then sent me an email, a design critique if you will, kindly enclosing a re-hashed version of the design that ‘he did on the train’. This gave me a basic overview of each area of my sins: - Typography
- Colour
- Use of space
- Use of images
- Those <em>stars</em></p>

<p>Ok, time to get serious. I must admit to having my pride a little battered by Paul’s redesign, but he’s an awesome designer and a great friend. I just thought this would be funny - And a chance to put both designs out there. I’ve uploaded Paul’s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/1436576069/in/photostream/">Homepage</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/1436574505/">About Page</a> to Flickr. Please feel free to take a look and rip either or both versions. Again, it’s over to you!</p>
