Yes, this weekend saw the biggest move away from Brownhills since University. I am now an official WS1 resident, slap bang in the middle of picturesque Walsall. I guess this has been coming ever since I realised that <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/2006/01/08/my-spritual-home/">Walsall </a> (at least for the moment) is where I need to be. The Kidz Klub thing continues in Coalpool and I can see scope for getting a lot more involved there.</p>
