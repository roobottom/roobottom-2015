Walsall admittedly could be described as a shit hole, having been done down by such literacy geniuses as <a href="http://www.chavtowns.co.uk/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=816" title="Walsall on chavtowns.co.uk">chav towns</a> and even <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=97428" title="What's Walsall Like?">Google</a>. But I would like to offer a different point of view. Walsall isn’t what he buildings look like, or the amount of money spent on some new statue in the middle of town - It’s the people. I’m sure this is true of anywhere you live… In the words of <a href="http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org" title="Walsall Community Church">Vic</a>… &gt; People Are Important</p>

<p>So I’d like to stand against all the crap spoken about Walsall, and say if we are to improve our town we should be proud of it! It’s a diverse miss-mash of people who for the most part are brilliant. Yeah, we have our problems and our rough areas, but where doesn’t? Thank God for Walsall, and the people in it. We really could be great!</p>
