            <p>Hats off to <a href="http://www.tiscali.co.uk">Tiscali</a> who over recent weeks and months have been providing me some of the poorest service I’ve ever recived. I had a Tiscali account over a year ago which I transfered to a different phone number, but unbeknown to me they’d left the tag on the original line. So in Nov last year when I tried to set up a new BT broadband account BT told me I needed a MAC code, and suggested I talk to tiscali, which I did… Tiscali said (after a few calls) they couldn’t give me a mac code, but they could request the tag removed from the line… This would take 2 weeks. 2 weeks later it wasn’t done. so I requested it again… and guess what.. yup.. still not done, and anther two weeks wait. In April I decided to start keeping a track of this promise / 2 week wait cycle…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 13th April 2007 at 15:00 Spoke to Matthew who said the TAG still hadn’t been removed from the line and he’d email his manager Warren to put pressure on BT to get this done quickly. I was given case number 576194</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 18th April 2007 at 14:47 Spoke to Levi who said he could see they’d put this case through a few times. It’s been put through as a high priority case and the line will be freed by 27th April.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 1st May at 10:15 I phone again and spoke to Calib who put me on hold for 7 mins.. then told me the TAG was still on the line and there was a problem with the account. He said he’d pass my details to Alan, his line manager, who he’d get to contact me later on today (yeah… )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I’m stuck. I have no broadband or hope of getting it anytime soon, or any idea how to get this sorted. I now desperately need broadband at home, as my new job pretty much requires that I have it. Other people must’ve had problems with Tiscali (or tiscali-esc companies) before. What did you do? Where do I go from here?</p>
