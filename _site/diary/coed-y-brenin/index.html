            <p>This may be one of my last posts, I haven’t decided yet the best way to take rdc forward. As i’m using Flickr more and more i’m finding that a picture tells a story much better than a blog, plus you get to be part of a massive community rather than floating around the edges. Plus finding time (or rather making time) to write is becoming more of a drag. Anyway, we went to Newquay for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/474050/">Paul’s Stag Do</a> And we went to Coed-y-Brenin to ride the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/509786/">Red Bull Course</a>.</p>
