But I couldn’t stand the crappy theme that came with it. But, wait a punk-ass minute - I thought, Aren’t I supposed to be some kind of interface designer? Some sort yeah, but never the less I still managed to come up with my own little roobottom theme when I had a spare hour last night. So, I’m sharing it with you (un)lucky people, it works well on my K810, and I imagine also on the K800 too! It’ll do me until I get my grubby mits on an iPhone anyway!
