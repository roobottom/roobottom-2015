Thurs 15th sees the boys return in series 3 of the Boosh on BBC 3. If you’re a UK dweller, you can see it now on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/">BBC 3 website</a> - That is if you can put up with the turd that is Realplayer… Why oh why did the BBC choose such a cack media type? Oh well, You Tube has it too (no, I’m not going to link to it - where would be the fun in that?). And yeah, they’re back in true form. Maybe not quite as quality as the genius that was Old Greg with a funky ball of tits from outer space, but good things will come. Episode one, Eels, sees the return of the Stitcher and his Chelsea boots - and some obvious increases in production budget. Genius genius genius all the way. They’re back! Get in!</p>
