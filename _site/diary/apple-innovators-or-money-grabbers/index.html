In fact, I’ve been thinking about Apple’s money grabbing tactics for a few days. I really want an iPhone - it has (most)everything I want (ok, except G3, a decent camera, Bluetooth file exchange, Video calling, &amp; GPS). The only problem with the iPhone is the talk plans - O2 can pretty much get away with charging what they want - and they do! <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/promo/iphonetariffs">£35 per month for 200 minutes and 200 Texts</a> is laughable. Yes, you get the unlimited data package, but that’s not even G3. OK, So that’s O2 - but don’t Apple get some kind of kickback from each tariff? £5 per month? They’re raking it in! What about if you want to assign your favorite pumping club tune, or a bit of the old Spice Girls as your ringtone, just to prove how cool you are. Well, even if you’ve been a good boy (or girl) and payed for the tune from iTunes Store, you have to pay again to turn it into a shorter version of itself! It just feels to me that Apple are devising more and more ways to squeeze as much money from us as they can. Is this right? Is this fair? No, defiantly not! But will we stop buying their mouth-wateringly cool products? Well, I’ll let you decide that one for yourself! And as for a new phone, so far I’m thinking <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/p1i">Sony Ericsson P1</a>, but that keyboard and smaller screen is putting me right off… Come on guys, help me out here. What should I be getting?</p>
