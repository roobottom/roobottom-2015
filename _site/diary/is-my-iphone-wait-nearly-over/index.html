            <p>Let me tell you, I was bloomin excited on Monday to be able to order the new iPhone 3G. Especially as some of my mates had such a hard time getting on the O2 website let alone actually being able to order the thing. It seems that O2 had expected maybe 100,000 hits total for the day. What they actually got was 250,000 by lunchtime. And while we’re on the subject, the O2 website is AWFUL! So it’s now 34 minutes into July 11th, and I should be writing this confident in the knowledge that a friendly UPS guy will knock on my door in a few hours and proudly present me with my shiny new phone. But I’m not… Far from it. The fact I received a email from O2 today telling me they’d refund any postage I’d payed didn’t exactly fill me with confidence. So we’ll see.. I’ll update this post thought the day. Boring as it may be, I’m excited about it. I’m also keen to see if Lloydy and Ellen manage to get themselves one from the store.</p>

<p>Well, after speaking to a very nice Scottish woman, and despite ordering my iPhone at 8:03am on Monday - it looks as if I won’t be getting my new toy today. In fact, according to her (I think she took pity on me after hearing my disappointed “oh”) I’m looking at around another two weeks. Gutted. Hope you had better luck Lloydy. ## Update - July 14th</p>

<p>I was in the Apple store in Birmingham yesterday and they had plenty of iPhones. It’s a bit annoying when I’ve ordered one like a week in advance, and now have to wait another two to get mine. I really don’t understand why Apple can’t help O2 fill some of their pre-existing orders rather than selling to new customers in store. I’m now toying with the idea of canceling my online order and trying my luck at the store. ## Update - July 14th @ 12.40pm</p>

<p>Called O2 who say my iPhone will be delivered on Friday.. I’m not holding my breath! ## Update - July 17th</p>

<p>Still no iPhone, but I did get my bill via email! Yeah! O2 so far are AWESOME!! no. really.</p>
