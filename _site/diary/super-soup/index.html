            <p>I dunno why I found this so funny, well, interesting I guess.. Paul in the office brought a <a href="http://www.loydgrossmansauces.com">Loyd Grossman</a> soup that supposedly you can fit in the microwave. When he discovered that it actaully wouldn’t fit in our stinky office micro he decided to exercise his consumer rights by writing a review of the soup on a <a href="http://www.reviewcentre.com/">certain review site</a>… <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/280549646/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/79/280549646_ffeb952e4e.jpg" alt="It FITS!!!" /></a> Paul said:</p>

  <p>Hey Loyd! Next time you design the packaging for a soup suitable for microwave heating why not make sure it stands up in the microwave?</p>

<p>Which I thought was a pretty resonable thing to say, the people at the review site however had other ideas… &gt; Dear poppa999, Thank you for submitting your review of Lloyd Grossman Maris Piper Potato &amp; Leek soup to Review Centre (www.reviewcentre.com). Unfortunately it has not been approved for one or more of the following reasons. 1. Your review was too short and hence may not have contained enough valuable information. 2. Your review may have been on a religious or political topic or contained sexual content. 3. We feel that you may be reviewing your own or a competitor’s product for the good of your own business. 4. Your review criticised other people or a business in such a way that to publish it might make Review Centre liable to legal action. Please do not let this discourage you from re-writing your review or writing further reviews on the website. Kind Regards, The webmaster</p>

<p>So it seems that even when you have a valid point, you can’t get it aired. Hmm.. maybe I’m just running out of ideas of what to write. More soon.</p>
