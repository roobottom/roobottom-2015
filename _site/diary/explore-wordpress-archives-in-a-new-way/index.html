            <p>One of the biggest parts of the <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/2007/09/24/face-lift/">recent upgrades</a> was a revolutionary new way to explore the <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/archives/">Roobottom archives</a>. Instead of the standard Wordpress list of archive months, the Archives display a full list of posts in a kind of pseudo calendar view. In this way, it’s easy to browse back through the years and take in the wonder and beauty of roobottom through the ages. But now, even more goodness. I’ve integrated my Flickr photos in with the archives, so that each time you visit you’ll see a random picture for each month (if there are pictures for that month). You can even link directly to the full Flickr archive. Oh, and I’ve updated the comment system to give you a little more feedback. It hopefully will put an end to the confusion over comments being held in moderation. So what next? I’ve made upgrades galore, but it’s stuff that I wanted and I thought was cool. But what do you want? Do you even care? Here’s a few ideas I had to kick off.</p>

<ol>
  <li>An easier (but still spam-proof) way to comment</li>
  <li>Monthly Video Blogs (my face and voice coming at ya)</li>
  <li>More fun with the Archives.</li>
  <li>Writing a WP plugin to make the Archives available to all</li>
</ol>
