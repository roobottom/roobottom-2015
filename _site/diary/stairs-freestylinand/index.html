            <p>How cool am I? (By the way, this is a rhetorical question, I don’t expect an answer cos I already know). Last night I bravely dived all the way down the stairs. With no thought of my own safety, I heroically lunged down what <em>must</em> have been about 100 steps. Ok, back to reality. Last night I fell down the stairs. But as <a href="http://www.mrheaton.blogspot.com/">Matt</a> pointed out I did the classic ‘slide’ manoeuvre instead of the more deadly ‘tumble’. Yeah, so, I’m a bit banged up but nothing I can’t handle (at this point I want ladies to my left for sympathy and dudes to my right for high-fives). Are there more ways of falling down stairs? In fact it doesn’t have to be stairs, it could be any household obstacle. Have I accidentally invented the coolest new sport since extreme championship dominoes? I mean I’m not recommending you try this one at home kids, unless like me you have Elly to catch you. But I think there may be potential for this sport at the Olympics. Keep an eye out for it.</p>
