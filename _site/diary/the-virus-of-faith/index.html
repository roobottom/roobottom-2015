            <p>I really enjoyed the second installment of Richard Dawkin’s “The Root of All Evil” last night (8:00pm Channel4). Starting at the end, his summing up was, and I don’t think I’m being too over-zealous here, nothing short of poetic brilliance.</p>

<p>Yes Richard, yes we are. And thank God for that. Dawkins’ attack on religion was aimed squarely at “inherited” faith. That is to say that children are automatically labeled with their parents faith, indoctrinated into their views from birth. This was one of my (many) arguments against faith when I was a teenager, admittedly a little less eloquently argued than Prof. Dawkins, but the same essential point. I had a friend when I was younger, lets call him Garry, who was one of the very few Christians I knew. I used to attack his faith all the time, try and back him into a corner, just to score points off him. I was so sure I was right, my arguments made perfect sense to me. “God?” I said, don’t be so ridiculous! Thinking about it now, I’m not sure why I was even bothered, what did it matter to me if he believed in a lie? But I was adamant, I needed to educate him. One day he snapped. “Do you think I’m stupid?” he said. “Not stupid, just brain washed” I retorted, enjoying the challenge. “Look,” he said, “I’m going to tell you something. Something that I’ve never really told anyone”. And so he preceded to tell me the story of his faith. How it had always been on shaky ground. How, no matter what his parents (who had become Christians in adulthood) had told him about God, he’d never been sure. Well, that wasn’t strictly true, he’d been sure as a small child, the way that he was sure there was a Father Christmas, but as he grew up he began to question. “So, why do you still believe?” I said. And it turned out that it was the doubts, the questioning, that had finally led him to God. His faith before was based on an idea. His parents had given him a good grounding in the bible, but that’s all it was for him. Head knowledge. It wasn’t until he stared to question things that he was able to find out for himself, and meet God. The point I’m trying to make is this. It’s not just a head thing. Faith can’t be taught. It must start with God. Yes, you can teach a child all there is to know about the Bible, the Koran, or any number of holy books, but without God that foundation will crumble into nothing. I realize that I’m opening myself up for criticism by saying this, but that’s what the comments are for. Please, feel free to disagree with me. I know this doesn’t nearly address all the issues in last nights program, but needless to say it raised some problems for me. I don’t want to try and tackle things of which I have very little knowledge.</p>
