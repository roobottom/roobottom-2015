            <p>Like a little kid I was, queuing for <a href="http://www.madame-tussauds.co.uk/">Madame Tussuad’s</a> this Saturday morning. I was almost wetting myself with excitement we approached the “Queuing time approximately 30 minutes” sign. Being a bit of a London virgin, I’d never been to Madame T’s and was needless to say quite looking forward to it. Walking round the universal cry of “Don’t they look life like” was heard from young and old. And they did. They looked scarily real. So much so that when we came to the infamous chamber of horrors I was at first a little disappointed. There was one rather rubber looking thing in a cage, and that was it. But they do this to trick you. Trick you into thinking the chamber is crap. Then you go through the Chamber Live! As we stood in the que (queuing seems to be a recurring theme in London) waiting to go in, one woman ran out white as a sheet exclaiming “I can’t do that”… Wow, I thought, this must be good. At the door to the “Prison” (evidently of escaped mental patients driven mad… maybe by the fact that they were escaped but still in prison) a guide told us that the Chamber Live featured live actors (hence the name I guess) and they would get very close but not touch you, please don’t touch them. What a job these guys have. Hiding in a dark room all day scaring the s**t out of everyone who walks through. Coming right in your face snorting and panting. It was horrible, it was scary… It was awesome! So ends my post about a random Saturday in Madame Tussauds. If you get a chance to visit London… Go see this! It’s worth it.</p>
