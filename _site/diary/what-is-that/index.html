But not so last week on a visit to Tesco in Brownhills. I caught my first glimpse of the thing as I turned onto the Lichfield road. Getting closer I could see it was some kind of pick-axe wielding metal giant. Apparently this cost £70,000! I just don’t know what it’ll add to the area. Granted, we shouldn’t forget our heritage, but couldn’t have that money been better spent on a public service? Admittedly this isn’t a particularly educated opinion, but no doubt a question a lot of people in the area will be asking.</p>
