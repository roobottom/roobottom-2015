            <p>For some unknown reason I thought it would be a good idea to waste an hour of my life last night by sitting through <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle</a> (aka. Harold and Kumar get the Munches here in the UK). I wouldn’t say this film both sucked and blow’ed, but there was a definite feeling I’d just wasted</p>
