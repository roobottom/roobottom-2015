            <p>Churchill used to call his bouts with depression his “Black Dog”, that would ever so often come and visit him. I really didn’t know what depression meant, I always thought it was something people said when they were a bit sad about something. It wasn’t until my first year at University that I realised the crushing grip of depression. For those of you that don’t know; depression isn’t feeling a little sad. It’s a deep dark pit of despair, it grips you like a vice, squeezing your stomach sending poison round your body. That first time at University was exactly this. I couldn’t face doing anything. I didn’t care what I looked like, I couldn’t interact with people anymore, something had broken inside me and I didn’t know what it was or how to make it better. Slowly, so slowly I came out of it. I floundered there for a while, but it did get better. That was eight years ago. I remember for the longest time afterwards I was scared that It would come back, that the very act of being scared of it was going to cause it. Fear of fear is something I think we can all relate to, you wont do something because it may cause you to feel bad. I think in this context ‘bad’ is such an insipid word, but what word could you possibly use to describe the darkness of being depressed? I’ve had other bouts of it, mostly at Uni, but always come out the other side, perhaps a bit stronger for the experience. But I’ve not felt “bad” for ages. So that brings me to today. And I’m feeling low again. I wouldn’t say that I was depressed because I can remember that feeling, and that was a <em>lot</em> worse. This is sporadic, occasionally smacking me in the face. I do think it’s clouding my ability to think properly, to say what I really think because I’m in self preservation mode, doing what I can to make me feel ok. Well, that’s not strictly true, I haven’t lied or done something that would hurt someone just to make me feel better, it’s more that I don’t fully trust my own feeling at the moment. That said, I know I’ll get better. I’ve got God on my side. I know this post sounds so “oh, woe is me” but as it’s my diary, I don’t really care. Read it, don’t read it. It just helped writing it.</p>
