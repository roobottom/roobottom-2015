            <p><a href="http://www.mymeangirl.com">Chris Rhee</a> recently had a load of stuff stolen from his friends car. So he <a href="http://stolen.stoptape.com/">set up a site</a> to raise $5000 in $5 donations. And like charm, it’s working. At last count he’d already got over $700 from kind people who like his work, and want to help him carry on doing what he’s doing. But he’s not the first to use his relative web fame to generate funds. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> gave up his job to become a full time blogger, relent on, actually I don’t know how that guys makes his money… So how then does one make money from the web? There are several internet stars I guess, people who are famous to those in the know, those that tour the <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">web</a> <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/">confrenece</a> circuits. I’m talking about such luminaries as <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="http://molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a>, <a href="http://www.andybudd.com">Andy Budd</a>. Names which won’t mean a lot unless you’re in the know. I guess you have to have some kind of <a href="http://www.lloydyweb.com">natural talent</a>, or get some kind of <a href="http://www.ning.com">big break</a>, but for the rest of us? Well, I guess we count our chickens, get on with our run-of-the-mill web jobs and take our thrills where we can find them.</p>
