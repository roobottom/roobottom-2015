            <p>My good friend and awesome sound engineer <a href="http://www.rkaudio.co.uk">Richard Kemp</a> has recently discovered that some young whippersnapper in New York has shamelessly ripped off his website. Not only has he had the cheek to rip him off, he’s also done a p**s poor job of it. I mean, come on, if you’re going to copy someone at least do it well! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2542193144/" title="RK Audio Original by roobottom, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/2542193144_05e8618c45.jpg" alt="RK Audio Original" /></a> Kemp’s original is well though out, and he’s obviously spent some time on it - Creating a nice logo, and writing some really nice content. Then along comes RK Audio USA and WHAM! Looks like he just couldn’t be bothered. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2541369607/" title="RK Audio Rip Off by roobottom, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2021/2541369607_803f06cdcb.jpg" alt="RK Audio Rip Off" /></a> To be honest, there’s probably not a lot he can do about this, other than bask in the satisfaction that this other guy’s stuff is turd. Gutted.</p>
