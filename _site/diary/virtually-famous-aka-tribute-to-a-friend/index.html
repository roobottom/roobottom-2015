            <p>My old mate Lloydy has finally announced on <a href="http://www.lloydyweb.org/blog/2006/01/my_journey_so_far.php">his blog</a> (so I’m finally officially allowed to write this post), what a few of us have know for ages: He’s off to work for <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>. Well done mate, you’re now part of an elite. Amongst us so called “web designers” (yeah, I suppose i’d include myself there, although most people would just say ‘geek’), there are those that have risen above the rest. People like <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffery Zeldman</a> and <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> who now get to travel the world telling people like me about new innovations in the world of web. There are whole <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">confences</a> dedicated to it. It’s an exciting life in the non-stop, fun filled world of elite webbers. Ok, you might have sensed a hint of sarcasm in that last sentence, but I’ll admit that may be a bit of the green-eyed monster speaking. After all, it’s not every day that a large company head hunts one of your friends for their new lead designer. I genuinely expect great things from you Mr. Lloyd. And a set of free tickets to at media 2007 (where, of course, you’ll be the headline guest) wouldn’t go ammis. Good luck, God speed and all the best for this new chapter in your life. You deserve it mate.</p>
