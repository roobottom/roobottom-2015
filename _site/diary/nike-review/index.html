(Actually, what is right up my street is a cost-cutter and a pizza place, but that’s another story). Nike have just launched their new [Nike+ Sportsband](http://store.nike.com/emeastore/#,en,GB,url;stage,frontpage—187266//187267///</td>
      <td>1 “buy the Nike+ sportsband from the UK Nike Store.”). This is a small <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> pen type device that straps around your wrist and links wirelessly to a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">accelerometer</a> in your shoe. After running (or walking) the device connects to your computer and uploads all of it’s data to your online <a href="http://nikeplus.com">Nike+</a> account, where you can set challenges, goals, training programs and (even better) compare your stats with those of other runners from all over the world. ## Performance</td>

<p>In terms of accuracy, the Nike+ system is spot on. I calibrated the device using a know 1/4 mile and it got it dead on. Even using a small pouch to hold the sensor rather than the official Nike+ shoes the accuracy is perfect. The website is a bit of a hit and miss affair - The runs get uploaded ok, but the training section doesn’t really work for me at all. They need to debug that thing big time. But, there’s enough other features on there to keep me happy - and it’s the tracking of the runs that really interests me anyway. ## Price</p>

<p>As I’ve only just started running, I didn’t want to invest in an expensive pair of running shoes - So I brought a £40 pair of New Balance 736’s. To attach the Nike+ sensor to the shoes I used good old eBay to get a neoprene pouch that threads through the laces for £8 (inc P&amp;P). That works really well, it’s only just bigger than the sensor so it holds it very tightly - which is important for the accuracy of the sensor. The actual Nike+ band (including the sensor) is £40, which I thought was quite reasonable. I really wouldn’t recommend that anyone start like I did though - Get to a proper running shop and get yourself on their treadmill. They’ll be able to tell you what kind of shoes you need to support your particular style of running. I need to do this sharpish! ## Verdict</p>

<p>I love it! Perfect for keeping me motivated and challenged, and at £40 it’s reasonably priced. I just wouldn’t go buying the expensive Nike+ running shoes. ## UPDATE! Mon, 19th May</p>

<p>Ok, I’m not so happy. A couple of times the band failed to load my latest run onto the nike+ website. As this is the main functionality of the band, I’m pretty disgusted at this product right now. I’ve emailed the support guys, so lets see what that say… Watch this space.</p>
