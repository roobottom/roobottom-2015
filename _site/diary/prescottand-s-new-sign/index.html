            <p>I’m sure many of you will have seen the story that Mr.Prescott has spent <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2512378,00.html">£645 of tax money on changing his office sign</a>. And for the most part I agree it’s a complete waste of money. I did, however, find ITV’s report on the story a bit laughable, and at worst the kind of sensationalist repoting that I hate. To demonstrate the high cost of Prescott’s sign the reporter was seen buying a “sign” in a near by prontaprint shop. They then went on to say “This cost us £9, that’s a difference of £636 that Mr. Prescott could have saved the tax payer.” What they didn’t point out was that the “sign” that they’d had mad was simply a printed piece of A4 paper (£9 was a bit of a rip-off to be honest) where as the sign for the deputy Prime Minsters office obviously needed to be a <em>little</em> more robust than that. Oh well, a bit random I guess, but it really wound me up. Maybe it’s all the Christmas shopping addling my brain.</p>
