            <p>Ah, there’s nothing quite like basking in the warm glow of making a comment that stuns everyone in the room into silence. So it was one rainy October day in 2003, as Ross, Colin and I were trying to decide on whatever entertainment our dwindling student loans would allow. When, for some reason, my brain engaged my mouth without even asking me if it was OK and I herd myself say…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know, lets play the hello world game! You know, where you have to think of as many ways as you can that you could write “hello world” in a programming language. Then the others have to guess what language you’re writing in!</p>

<p>It was a shameful moment for me. I knew as soon as I said it that it was a mistake. It was half meant as a joke, but there was no getting away from the disdainful looks that the others gave me. There was no choice, I had committed myself to this, and now I had to see it through, so I opened my and out flew this gem… &gt; I’ll go first. What language is this… “Response dot write ‘hello world’ ?”</p>

<p>Needless to say Colin and Ross have taken the p*** ever since. ## The Century!</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated matter, this is my 100th post. Hopefully it wont take another <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/2004/12/12/8/">year and eight months</a> to write another 100. I might even get myself a little cake to celebrate!</p>
