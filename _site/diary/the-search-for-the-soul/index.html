            <p>Lets forget religion for a moment. Forget what the world tells you about faith or science and ask yourself the question: Do you honestly believe that we are no more than a bag of bones and other assorted stuff that all fits together to make us human? Can you conceive that there is absolutely no more beyond what we can smell, touch, taste, see and hear? If the answer is an absolute genuine ‘yes’ to this, then stop reading. You’re excused. Go off and play somewhere. For the rest of us, I want to explore why we think this. Is it inbuilt by a creator to lead us on a life long search for him? Or is it a result of evolution, that this longing to believe in something bigger than us, something after death is somehow an essential survival tool that gave out ancient ancestors the edge of the people who didn’t believe. It’s arguable that the worlds oldest “religion” was <a href="http://www.answers.com/Animism">Animism</a>. This is a general term to describe the belief in spirits, ghosts, gods call them what you will. Essentially other beings that have a hand in the affairs of man, and by extension a belief in the human soul which survives the body after death. It’s everywhere throughout history, I can’t think of any historical cultures where faith or a belief in something, <em>anything</em>, wasn’t a central feature. It seams to me that throughout the whole of human history we have been seeking “god” in some form or another. So on the one hand we have a creator. The maker of heaven and earth, that gave us life, free will and an inbuilt desire to find him. If indeed god is the God of the Bible, then an overwhelming theme of life is love. Free will gives rise to the potential for evil. So God takes a risk, he creates these beings that He can love and then sets them free. If they come back to Him then He’ll have love in return, not obedience out of fear. But He also gives them a fighting chance, He plants the seeds of faith, the inbuilt idea that there is indeed “something more”. On the other hand we have evolution. Darwin tells us that all life on Earth evolved from some simpler form of life over a period of millions of years, certain traits dying out and others surviving based on how well those things equipped a creature to not to get killed. (I know this is a massively simplified version, but for the purposes of this post please bear with me.) So what of things like faith? Could we have evolved a need to believe in things because it gives us an edge over the other guys? I suppose it gives us hope, and hope is a powerful thing. It’s a bit of a weird one this. I’m now not 100% sure of the point I was trying to make, if indeed I had one in the first place. All I know is that the search for the human soul is not an easy thing, and I don’t think I’ll ever have any kind of an answer until I die.</p>
