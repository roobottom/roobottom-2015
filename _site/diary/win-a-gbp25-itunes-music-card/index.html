            <p>You’re giving away what? Yes, that’s right! You could be the owner of a shiny new Music Card pumped full of £25 worth of credit. All I want you to do is design me a new footer.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-footer">A New Footer?</h3>

<p>Yes, ever since the design re-launch the footer has been a kind of work in progress. In it’s current state, it’s simply functional - I’d hardly call it beautiful. But looks aren’t everything, a footer should be the work horse of any decent blog, linking to things that’re going to pull in traffic left right and center. So then, these are the things that I want from my footer… - Good Looks - In a word - Stunning (obviously fitting in with the rest of the site)
- A link to my CC licence
- A link to Wordpress.org
- A link to lloydyweb
- I have two ‘traffic’ links on here at the moment, I kinda want to keep the technoranki…
- Anything else you can think of that is essential for a good footer
- Valid xhtml 1.0 Transitional</p>

<p>So I’ll be judging all entries (assuming I get any) on their design AND functionality. Bonus points for original ideas, or integrating (good) third party tools. ### The prize, the deadline and all that gumph</p>

<p>The prize is a £25 iTunes Music Card for use in the UK store (sorry guys from other countries). Feel free to enter if you’re not from the UK, I can still send you the card, use it if you can. I’ll be judging all the entries, and my decision is final. Closing date for entries is 28th June 2006, and the winner will be announced on this site a week later (5th July 2006). All images, code and anything else that goes with your entry becomes my intellectual property. You agree to to all these terms when you enter. Nothing scary, just want to make sure no one can come back demanding money for using their design, cos that’s just mean. ### Ok, ok, so how do I enter?</p>

<p>Look at the html / css that currently make up the footer (easy for those in the know), and design something spectacular. Zip it all up and e-mail it to <span class="emailCloak">makeMeAFooter(at)roobottom.com</span>. I’m looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with.</p>
