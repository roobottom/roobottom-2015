I vividly remember the Christmas I unwrapped the Lego Technic car; I'd been dreaming about it all year, and here it was. All mine! I don't really recall much else from that festive period other than building that car.

Making it again has been almost as enjoyable as that first time, a trip down memory lane with each brick. And I'm impressed that there was only one piece missing from the whole model. Time for it to go back in storage, but no doubt I'll see it again, perhaps when my children inherit it.
