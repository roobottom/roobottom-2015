First day back in the Brighton office. The milk left in the fridge over Christmas had evolved and had some actually really good ideas on how best to tackle the grid system I'd been struggling with.

I took the traditional route for the lunchtime walk, down the London Road and snapped this shot of the Royal Pavilion.
