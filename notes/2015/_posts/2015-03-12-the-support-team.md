I'm sure much to their delight, the Firefly support team were told that I'd be taking their mug shots for the new [Firefly help site](http://help.fireflylearning.com/) today.  Unaccustomed as I am to portraiture photography means I was probably more nervous than them. Lack of any lights meant I had to shoot all the photos with built in flash, a light scoop and what little light remained through the window in the office. Despite this, I think they're not too bad.
