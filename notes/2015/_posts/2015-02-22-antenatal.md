"Oh, joy" I thought when Katie told me she'd booked us in for an Antenatal class. Almost to add insult to injury it was going to take up a _whole_ Sunday. I gritted my teeth and braved the seven-forty-something-awful wake up time. What followed turned out to be one of the most surprisingly brilliant days I've had in a long time.  Afterwards, Katie and I had a lovely meal in the Black Rabbit in Arundel.
