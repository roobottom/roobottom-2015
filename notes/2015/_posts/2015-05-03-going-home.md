Baby roo was discharged from hospital. We finally get her home, which is a good but slightly scary thing without the support of the midwives. Our friends Ian and Tania, who had a baby about an hour before us, and with whom Katie had been sharing a ward, went home just moments before us.

The fact that Katie and Tania got to share this experience and even have beds next to each other is nothing short of a miracle. In fact, the more I think about the birth the more I'm overwhelmed by the amazing care Katie received in Worthing hospital. All the midwives were exceptional.
