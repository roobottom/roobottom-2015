Weather-wise today wasn't much cop, so we decided that we'd visit the only Museum on the Island, wherein we saw all manner of things, including a collection of incredibly creepy dolls. Then, a traditional cream tea at Juliet's where we were swamped by the usual collection of bird life begging for crumbs. Later we rounded off the day with a few ales and a game of _tÃªte de la merde_ in Tregarthens.
