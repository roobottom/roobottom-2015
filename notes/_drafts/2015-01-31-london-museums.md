Today we took our eldest niece up to London for a day exploring the Natural History and Science Museums. I'm not sure who was more excited; me or Amelie, as the three of us braved the snow and headed to the capital.

Later Amelie told us that her favourite bit was the huge collection of rocks, precious stones and crystals in the Natural History Museum. Katie and I really enjoyed playing parents for the day, even if we did feed her crap. She was returned to Mum in one piece, so we couldn't have done that badly.
