I've been wondering about contact lenses for a while now. While Katie and I were in Rustington today, on the off chance, I asked about them in Specsavers. _"Come right through Mr. Roobottom"_. 

Half an hour later I was embarrassingly unable to get one of them back out. _"Keep your eye open"_ said the sales assistant. So _thats_ where I'd been going wrong! Eventually the little bugger popped out of my eye, it probably felt sorry for me. _"Right"_ Ms. Assistant said beaming _"we just need to see you put them in and out a couple more times..."_
