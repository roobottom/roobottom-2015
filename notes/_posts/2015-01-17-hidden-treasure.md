While replacing some broken floorboards I made an exiting discovery in the form of an empty bag of Golden Wonder Ready Salted from the 80's. It must've been left by the original builders. Just to add to the fun I just found [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23574881@N06/3494194715) of another bag of the same crips. Yay!
