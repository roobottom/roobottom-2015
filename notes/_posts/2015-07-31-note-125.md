Due to some miscalculation I had some holiday to use up, so I took today off. Katie, baby R and I had a lovely walk adventure in the sunshine around Littlehampton and Rustington, taking in the beach and the new Waitrose. Baby R was impressed.

Later, Beth came round for dinner and we plied her with Pimm's.
