I think we're still trying to work out this family thing. What _do_ you do all day with a baby who doesn't really any have any wants beyond a clean nappy and the occasional nipple shoved in her mouth? 

Well, we decided that _we_ wanted an Ice Cream; its all about our needs after all. As it was a nice day we headed to Arundel where we took a little stroll (nothing too strenuous), then sat by the river eating our ice cookie things. 

I pretty sure that baby Roo enjoyed it too, I mean just look at that little face. She looks enthralled.
