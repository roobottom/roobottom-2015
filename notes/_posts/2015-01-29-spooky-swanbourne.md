Swanbourne Lake in the grounds of Arundel Castle is a picturesque place to visit on a fine summer's day. In the dead of a freezing-cold winter's night it's less appealing. So why I was picking my way along its banks at 11pm is anyones guess. I was headed for the beautifully run down boat house. Years of neglect, spider webs and the scrawling of local kids made this an ideal location for a bit of light painting.

I did take a few shots, this was probably the best from a bad bunch, but I'm far from happy with the results. Still, it was good to scout out as a location. I'm sure I'll be back.
