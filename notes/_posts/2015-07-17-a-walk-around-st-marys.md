There are certain traditions that one must do when visiting the Scilly Isles. Perhaps the most important being a walk around St.Mary's, via Toleman's Caf√©. So that's exactly what we did. Katie and Baby Roo joined us for the brunch at the Toleman boys (which disappointed a little this year) and then David, Catherine and I set off round the island on what promised to be a gloriously sunny day. All was well until we hit the three-quarter way point and the heavens opened. We walked the rest of the way with wet pants.

Later, family Roo took sunny walk around the harbour. A very pleasant day with many warm family feelings was had by all.
