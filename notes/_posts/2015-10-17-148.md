Baby Roo seems to have her heart set on growing up, a feat she's accomplishing at quite a rate of knots. This week she's been trying out some real food, and absolutely yumming it up. As a distraction from a pursuit that will no doubt see her leave this baby stage behind faster than we'd like, her mother and I took her out for a lazy afternoon.
