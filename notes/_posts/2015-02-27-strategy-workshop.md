Being let down by Southern Rail meant I was the last to arrive at the Firefly strategy workshop. Despite the embarrassing late start, the day was really rather good. We jumped into several blue oceans wearing an array of silly hats. 

It was also my mom's birthday — we headed up to chez Roo senior in the evening, the last time we'll do that drive before the baby comes.
