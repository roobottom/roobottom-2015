As close friends will know I made a big move in August, one that saw me packing up my life in [Walsall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall) and moving 200 miles to the South-coast.

{% include figure.html set="beach" %} 

The last two-and-a-bit months in [Littlehampton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlehampton) have been fun to be sure, but *very* different to my life in Walsall. I just want to say a BIG thanks to all the people who've made me feel so welcome, and an equally big thanks to friends in Walsall for being so supportive of me moving away. 

It's great to have joined a [new church](http://www.aruncommunitychurch.com/), where I've been made to feel very at home, but sad to have left behind such a [great community](http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/).
