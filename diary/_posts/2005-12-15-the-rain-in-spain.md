Let's say for example that you commented on someones [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) photos, and six months later you fly out to Spain to visit them. Well funnily enough (cue sincere laughter) that's exactly what happened to me... Madrid was awesome, and a good time was had by all. We saw castles, bars, mountains, bars, shops, bars, trains, planes and automobiles. Oh, and bars. But all this got me thinking up until I'd actually spent more than one afternoon with Liz I'd been feeling a little... seedy... about meeting someone over the internet. Maybe that's not the right word, but my limited vocabulary doesn't allow me to be any more descriptive. I'm sure you know what I mean, 'meeting' people via the internet does have a certain stigma attached to it. I'm very happy to say in this case my new friend (who I've firmly move up from 'flickr friend' status) turned out to be awesome, but there's always that danger that the person you are online isn't the real you. I've done it myself, been someone else online just 'cos it's easy to do. Not to mention fun. I wonder if it's just me with this mental stigma, or do other people think the same?
