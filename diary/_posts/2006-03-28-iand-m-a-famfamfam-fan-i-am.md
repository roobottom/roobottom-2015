![FamFamFam Silk Icons](http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/famfamfam.gif) I used to do a bit of pixel art, you know, using one pixel at a time to build up amazingly complex [city-scapes](http://hello.eboy.com/eboy/?cat=2). As you can imagine, my designs prowess didn't quite stretch to these dizzying heights, so I'm always impressed when you see someone with real talent for the medium. One such talent is Mark James of [FamFamFam](http://www.famfamfam.com) who created the wonderful Silk icon set that is currently making an appearance on this very website. Such talent, and such a lot of icons (1000) all for free! So get yourselves over there now and feed on the rich pickings on offer.
