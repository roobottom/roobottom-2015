title: Creating Panoramas on Mac
---
Whist in Italy I took the opportunity to capture several images of the same thing - [the bay at Salo](http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=1586201273&size=large), [the Tower at Sirmione](http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=1586192663&size=large) and the [Arena in Verona](http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=1586219647&size=large). Now by themselves, they look pretty rubbish, but stick them in a crazy-go-nutts program called [Calico](http://www.kekus.com/) and out the other end you get beautiful panoramic shots. I'm so impressed with this software. I didn't use a tripod for these shots, I simply ensured there was plenty of overlap and then exported them full-res from iPhoto. Once in Calico I simply loaded the photos in, and clicked Align.

Alignment, colour balance, the lot! Crop off the black edges and you can't tell the photos were ever separate.

Sorry for those of you with a PC - perhaps someone could suggest something similar for other platforms?
