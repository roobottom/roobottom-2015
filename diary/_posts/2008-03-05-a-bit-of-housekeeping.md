title: A Bit of Housekeeping
---
![The WP register screen](http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/wp-register.jpg)<span class="dcap">S</span>ome of the keener eyed among you may have noticed a few little housekeeping changes around the site. These are a forerunner to a larger update planned later this year. I don't want to give away too much yet (as ideas are still in the process of forming) but hopefully the upgrades will promote a greater sense of community around the place. I'm busy getting to grips with [JQuery](http://jquery.com) and Wordpress plugin writing in any spare moment I can grab. But whats new *now* I hear you cry. Well, here's a full list of (small) changes to satisfy the nosy ones. 1. I've cleaned up the content text styles. Lists are now more behaved, and some other tiny tweaks have been made
2. I've installed the brilliant [Subscribe to Comments plugin](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/). This should serve to start building community in preparation for the big changes. (I can't stop myself saying too much can I?)
3. You can now [register](http://www.roobottom.com/diary/wp-login.php?action=register)! At the moment this will save you typing in your details when you leave a comment, but there's more planned for this too!
4. I've also tided up some other random bits of css - None of which I can be bothered to go into here.

 Anyway, Enjoy...
