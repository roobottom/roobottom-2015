The Mighty Boosh? Wolverhampton Civic Hall? 9th March 2006? 7 O'clock? Yes, we'll have a bit of that.


Although I've only even seen one episode of the [tv series](http://www.themightyboosh.com/) I had already realised the genius of the Boosh. One time is enough you see, one time only to drink in the sweet sweet nipple-nectar from the Boosh's comedy teat. 

In review I can only say brilliant brilliant brilliant! It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me spit my beer over the guy in front. Sorry. 

I'd recommend that you all go, but I'm pretty sure it's all sold out. (I guess some simple checking would have confirmed this, but I really can't be bothered). Anyway, you can always look at some [fine photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mightyboosh/) of the event.
