**Katie**'s uncle **Bill** is about to embark on a harebrained scheme to raise some cash for the <abbr title="Royal National Lifeboats Institution">RNLI</abbr>. Together with his mate **Dave** (*everyone's got a mate Dave*) they'll be traveling the entire length of the English and Welsh coast using nothing but their free bus passes.

You can support the old sods by texting **SAVE** to **84424**, they'll get **Â£1.50** (but some, very nasty, networks may charge you *slightly* more). Or donate on their [just giving](http://www.justgiving.com/sillyoldsods) page, and that way they'll get ALL your lovely wonga, and if you're a UK TAX payer, they'll get that too. They've set up a website so you can track their progress, checkout [sillyoldsods.co.uk](http://www.sillyoldsods.co.uk) for more information on the trip.
