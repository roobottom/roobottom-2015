title: What a Rip Off
---
My good friend and awesome sound engineer [Richard Kemp](http://www.rkaudio.co.uk) has recently discovered that some young whippersnapper in New York has shamelessly ripped off his website. Not only has he had the cheek to rip him off, he's also done a p**s poor job of it. I mean, come on, if you're going to copy someone at least do it well!

Then along comes RK Audio USA and WHAM! Looks like he just couldn't be bothered.

Gutted.
