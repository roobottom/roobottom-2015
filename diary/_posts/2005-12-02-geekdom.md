Yes, I am a fully paid up, registered, nerd. But, I feel I have recently been remiss in my nerd duties. For example, it's been ages since I've posted anything on the diary, or done any kind of design... but dare I say it, it's time... I just need to get the bug again, the design bug. I've been doing some really nice stuff at work lately (even though I do say so myself) and I think it's time I brought some of my new skills to bear on roobotom dot com. Don't worry Lloydy, I'll also spend some time on the joint projects we've talked about.... That is all.
