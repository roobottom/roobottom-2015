You can now download the rdc* theme for Word Press inspired by the design of this diary. I've set up a [new blog](http://www.roobottom.com/wp_theme/) styled by the new theme, and you'll be able to download it from there. Happy Word Pressing! **UPDATE** You should now download the new version (0.4), check out the theme blog for the latest updates.
