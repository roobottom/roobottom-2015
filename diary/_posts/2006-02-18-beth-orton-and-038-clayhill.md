Big thanks to Nash who took us to see [Beth Orton](http://www.bethorton.mu/) & guests last night in Warwick. I'd not really heard any of her stuff before, and after last night still can't say I'm a massive fan. Don't get me wrong, she was good, just need to listen to more I think. In fact, for me, the best bit of last night was the "& guests" who turned out to be a band called [Clayhill](http://www.clayhillmusic.com). [![Clayhill](http://static.flickr.com/33/101165891_3ac2a79718.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/101165891/ "Check out this photo on Flickr") Clayhill are a scissor toting, xylophone playing 5 piece from (by the sounds of the guitarists accent) somewhere in the South West of England. Their blend of acoustic guitar and double bass funk was without doubt awesome. Awesome enough anyway to get me to buy not one but two of their albums in the interval. Favorite song of the night had to be "So Far Out" (at least I think that's what it was called), which continued some serious thrash-acoustic (yeah, it's possible) and well timed silences which seemed to suck all the sound out of the room. Also just gotta say a word about the bass player. This guy obviously has a real passion for music, and put his all into entertaining the people of Warwick last night. Everyone was Loving both the bass slides and the scissor work. Anyway, if you get chance, go and check 'em out. They're on the whole of Beth's UK tour.
