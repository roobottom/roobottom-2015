title: Top 10
---
Ever since our earliest days the Human race has been plagued by questions: Who are we? Why are we here? I've have spent the last few weeks pondering such a question. A question that has taxed my (some say feeble) brain to it's very limits. I've pondered, I've considered, I've wept in despair, and I let out a few little farts of frustration wondering just what are my 10 greatest albums of all time? 

I've compiled this list as an answer, I just hope I can get what those shrinks call closure on this issue. How can I decide this? I was thinking maybe _Jazz_ by Queen, or _Baby O'Riley_ by The Who, but what about Bowie? Nah, picking number 1 is just too difficult. 

1. Jury's still out
2. O - Damien Rice 
3. War of the Worlds - Jeff Wayne
4. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles
5. Make Yourself - Incubus
