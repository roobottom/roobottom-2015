title: Firefox Updated
---
I love Firefox, it's a suburb browser. Unfortunately I've recently noticed a few popups sneaking through Firefoxe's previously impenetrable security barrier. Luckily, Mozilla have just released [Firefox 1.0.1](http://www.getfirefox.com) that promises to fix some of these security holes. Suck on that Internet Explorer.
