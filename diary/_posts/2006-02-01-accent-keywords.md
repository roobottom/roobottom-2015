title: Accent Keywords
---
One thing I've been thinking about the last few days is accents. Yes pretty random I know, but it's been in there with all the other stuff that I really don't want to write about at the moment, so you've got to put up with this. Sorry. Anyway, the accents. Mine, for example, would be described as "Brummie" by someone who lived anywhere else in England except Birmingham, and they'd probably think I was a from Dudley. In fact, if you really want to localize it mine is a Walsall accent, coming from Brownhills as I do. But I guess that's not important right now, so I'm going with "Brummie". It was my mate Dave that pointed out that certain words sound better in some accents than they do in others. Brummies can really say the number five, putting the emphasis on the "fi" so it sounds like "fi-a-ve". Where as Geordie's do well with the word "Conjunctivitis", try it you'll see what I mean. So it seams to me that accents have their own keywords that really define them. Here are a few that I thought of...

- Conjunctivitis- Geordie
- Five (fi-a-ve) - Brummie
- Thirty Three and a Third (terty-tree and a turd) - Irish

 Well, I did say a *few*. Maybe you could come up with some more?
