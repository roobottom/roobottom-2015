![20x2](http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/20x2.jpg) Well, Sunday night I was poohing my pants waiting to speak at [20x2](http://www.20x2.org). Besides my [random drivel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rugbymadgirl/301979049/) about the history of my name, there were some pretty interesting answers to the question of the evening: Where Am I? Some that stuck out for me were... [Diego and his trumpet playing fairy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rugbymadgirl/301979092/in/photostream/); [David Frew's](http://www.acerbia.com/) 2 minute speed read of no less than two sides of A4 of his prose. Not only a cleaver chap but a thoroughly nice bloke; [Steve Marshall's](http://nascentguruism.com) answer which saw the entire audience standing up and sitting down on cue thanks to a cleverly written presentation. So, cheers to Kevin and the rest of the guys who put on a superb event which was enjoyed by every single last person in the room - and probably warmed the lives of those around just by it's pure existence. Oh, and you can find the original image used in this post [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/agsystems/301718041/in/pool-20x2/)... Thanks to agsystems, cos some di*k didn't take his camera. Oh, and the flickr pool [here](http://www.flickr.com/groups/20x2/pool/).
