And as regular visitors will know (guess this mean [Paul](http://www.lloydyweb.org "Llloydyweb")) things are looking a bit different. But, with any live re-design, it's a messy business. So this is where this post comes in. I need to test that my css'll cover a multitude of posting sins. Feel free to ignor the next bit... Sometimes we want make things **bold** or *italic*. Other times i'll have said something then want to <strike>cross it out</strike>. - This is a list
- It's not orderd
- But that's cool

1. This is another list
2. And this one is orderd
3. Rockin or what!

 And that's about it I think! Enjoy.
