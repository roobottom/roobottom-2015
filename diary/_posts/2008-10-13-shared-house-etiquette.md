title: Shared House Etiquette
---
Following on from a post earlier this year entitled "[You know when you're living in a shared house when...](http://www.roobottom.com/2008/05/28/you-know-youre-living-in-a-shared-house-when/)" I've had some further thoughts on the whole house sharing thing. Well, I say *some* further thoughts - more like one big lurking brown thought. As you may know I'm now living in another shared house - but this time with a bunch of guys and gals I didn't really know before I moved in. I'd say I was quite lucky in this respect - everyone has been awesome. But, I've just been to answer a call of nature and someone had left a rather large brown gift waiting for me. Despite 4 flushes, it refuses to budge - so I'm unsure what to do. What's the etiquette for this kind of situation. I mean, I know it's not mine, but it bloody stinks. Should I try an tackle it with a spoon? Give it a few more flushes? Or just leave it for the next unsuspecting person, who may or may not the owner of said object? Who knows - if you do - please comment with suggestions asap as I'm likely to have nightmares about what I like to call the "Lid Lifter". Thanks!
