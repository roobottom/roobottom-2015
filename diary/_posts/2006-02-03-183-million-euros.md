title: 183 Million Euros
---
Friday night is [Euro Millions](http://www.euromillions.be/default.aspx?culture=en&pageid=home) night, the huge lottery which is open to players all over Europe. This weeks jackpot is now up to a staggering 183 Million Euros. Take some time just to say that out loud, slowly... One hundred and eighty three *million* euros! Now that's a LOT of money. My question is this: Would it make you happy? For my part, I think the answer is a very resounding no. It's not that I wouldn't enjoy all the cool stuff that I could buy with the money, or even all the people I could help, it's more that I wouldn't trust myself not to let it go to my head. We've just been talking about this in the office, and the general consensus was that after a certain point the extra money is just meaningless. What difference does it make if you win a million or 183 million, it's still going to change your life just as much. What would you do with all that money? Is money an intrinsically evil thing, or is it just what people do with it? (ie, does money change you, or does money allow your natural tendencies to out?) Over to you for this one... What do you think?
