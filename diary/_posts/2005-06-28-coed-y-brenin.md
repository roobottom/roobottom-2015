This may be one of my last posts, I haven't decided yet the best way to take rdc forward. As i'm using Flickr more and more i'm finding that a picture tells a story much better than a blog, plus you get to be part of a massive community rather than floating around the edges. Plus finding time (or rather making time) to write is becoming more of a drag. 

Anyway, we went to Newquay for [Paul's Stag Do](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/474050/) And we went to Coed-y-Brenin to ride the [Red Bull Course](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/509786/).
