title: Bored Of Blogging
---
It's been a while (again) and that's simply for this one fact.. I'm bored of blogging. Sorry, but there you go. It's always the same old stuff, where I've been, who I've seen, what I've.... been doing. And there's a few billion other people who live lives too, so what makes mine so special that people want to read about it on the internet. But, here is a quick run down of (some of) the things I've been up to over the last few months. Littlehampton has been calling my name, many of you will know the sad news of Katie's dad, he was a top bloke who will be very very missed by all those he came into contact with. So I've been living my life somewhere on the A34. I've been to the seaside, up Snowdon (and back down again), to Matlock Bath (and up the cable cars) and taken a bath in Bath. It's been all about the Poker over the last couple of weeks, what with Sunday night's at Dans gaf, Mondays at Steve's and now Tuesday looks set to have it's own post-cell game, I'm loving it, and better yet not loosing any money (or betting any in the first place). As for work, I've got a few things up my sleeve, that will hopefully come to something good. Can't say too much at the moment tho. Anyway, that's it for now. Does anyone actually read this crap?
