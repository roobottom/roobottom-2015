title: Wild West Midlands
---
On my Friday lunchtime stroll in Lichfield park today I was surprised to find a whole load of Cowboys and Cowgirls gathered in tents, tee-pees, motor-homes and caravans for the Wild West Weekend. Ok, so Lichfield isn't in the Midlands, but it's near enough. Besides it's a clever title right? Right?? I love Lichfield for stuff like this, we'll randomly get interesting things in the park, but this has to be one of the most surreal ones I've seen to date. Especially the shootout at the OK Corral, where two guys shoot at metal targets about half a metre in-front of them [![Shootout at the OK Corral](http://static.flickr.com/78/212515047_9416c34c47.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/212515047/ "Photo Sharing") Wish I'd have had my camera with me rather than just my [phone](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/sets/72157594232951730/), those guys shooting stuff would've made some pretty cool pictures. Oh well, just thought I'd tell you about the random craziness that is occurring this weekend. If you're interested, get down there. It's on til Sunday apparently. Oh, and I resisted the lure of the Coca-Cola today!
