title: iPod Touch Me

Well, no great supprises but it turns out that there was an iPod touch in [the box](http://www.roobottom.com/2007/10/03/whats-in-the-box/). [![It's An Ipod!](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/1489282662_832043e428.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/1489282662/ "Photo Sharing") So far I love it! In the box you get: The iPod (ohhh momma), Headphones, USB cable, A silky cleaning cloth, one of those dock adapter things (so you can use the Touch with Apple Speakers, etc) and a crappy little plastic stand. No stickers (didn't they used to give you them with everything?) and a useless quick start guide in every language on God's green Earth. But onto the main event, the Touch itself. The interface is amazing! Even the keyboard (which pops up whenever you need to type anything) is easy to use, despite the keys looking too small for my chubby fingers to press. It really is well done, and well thought out! The pinch-zoom is awesome, as is the double-tap - both really intuitive. No wonder they don't provide a big manual, when it's this well thought out it's easy to use. You just kind of instinctively know what to do. Even the built in sound effects give you that warm glow of a well delivered feedback. I LOVE Coverflow on this - I only wish iTunes could find more of my album art. The accelerometer (the device that flips the display or puts the ipod into Coverflow mode when you tip-up the device) makes yet another thing that could have been a User Interface nightmare a snap to use. The only few gripes I have with it, so far, are...

- No Mail - What? Why? Come on Apple, why no mail app, surly this would be a natural thing to add in seeing how we have a web browser. Maybe they'll release this soon
- No Bluetooth - This would be really useful to transfer photos, etc with my mobile and other devices.
- The bug in Videos - Sometimes (randomly) videos will pixelate to such an extent as to make them unwatchable. This is sorted with a restart, but it's still annoying.
- No Quicktime in Safari - Again, What? Why? Maybe something to do with the zooming. Come on Apple, I'm sure your boffins can sort this.
- No games - Only a matter of time though I think

 So in summing up - yes, it was a bit of a splurge (the first big spend I've made in a very long time) - but I'm very impressed. I'm sure they'll be a new post soon about the dangers of the Mobile iTunes store! So look out for that one. I'm on holiday for a week now, so roobottom will be back after a short break.
