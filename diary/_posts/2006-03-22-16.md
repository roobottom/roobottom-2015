title: Jon's School Days

I had such an awesome day yesterday as Josie very kindly let me shadow her teach. Yeah, I was a bit nervous but also dead excited to be out of the office and having fun with a bunch of kids all day. 

Some of you will know that it's crossed my mind to go do teacher training in September, so wanted to see what it was all about before I signed up to anything. It's weird seeing one of your friends tech a bunch of 8 and 9 year old, to me it doesn't seem all that long ago that I was their age. I was really impressed with the way she controlled the class, and the obvious affection the kids had for her. 

I've got to say, teachers work damn hard. They work their collective asses off. Which is a bit of a sticking point for me. It's not that I'm adverse to a bit of hard work (ahem) but quite a lot of the paperwork seems so unnecessary. I can't imagine anyone becoming a teacher unless they had a passion for working with kids, and the government seems to be squashing this by putting undue pressure on hard working school staff. I'm not really ruling out teaching as a possibility, but I've spoken to entirely too many people in the profession that are bitter about the workload. 

I dunno, we'll see. It'd be good to check out a few more schools (and years) first I think. The best bit of the day for me was thirty-five manic kids singing me the bumblebee song. Awesome!
