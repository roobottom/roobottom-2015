title: Questionable Face Fashion
---
The decision to grow facial hair is one I took well over a year ago after being inspired by a [freind](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/123951703/) who's beard added a certain something cool to his face. So night and day for a solid month I'd have a constant straining-for-a-poo look on my face as I attempted to force the hairs out into the cold hard light of day. Eventually I [succeded](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/208455517/) in growing what some would call a beard, some would call "idiotic" and yet others would just call in to question. I did try removing the beard once, but this only resulted in me getting id'ed for beer in my local Tesco. I quickly regrew it, again employing the straining technique. So, for now at least, the questionable face fashion is staying. I did dabble with the idea of a [Tom Selleck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Selleck) cos I think every man needs to experience the feeling of a bristly top lip at least once in his life. I guess watch this space.
