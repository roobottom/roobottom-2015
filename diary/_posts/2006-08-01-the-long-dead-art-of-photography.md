Ah, I used to love a bit of photography, getting down in the mud to get that perfect low angle sharp focus background, soft foreground shot (you know the sort). But then, it all stopped.

Okay, so maybe it *isn't* the most creative idea in the world, but with other my friends out doing me at [every](http://www.flickr.com/photos/magic_dan/197330972/in/set-72157594210415711/) [turn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/derv1980/146301265/), I've gotta start catching up!
