title: Kidz Klub Coalpool
---
I've been involved in Kidz Klub (admittedly on and off) in [Coalpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalpool) for a while now, and this year I got to design the boards we use as a backdrop to the games and stuff we do with the local kids. I've loved working with the whole team over the last couple of years, and all credit to Esther, Sarah and the guys for the sterling work they do. Unfortunately, we're up against it as Walsall Council in their wisdom have decided to stop charging us the £20 per week rent we used to pay and increase it to £100! How nice of them. Obviously the KK needs to keep going, so any fundraising ideas (or indeed donations) are gratefully received. I put together the original design in good old Fireworks, the scale was a little off tho.. whoops!

Hannah then got to work painting...

Dee provided some lamiate stickers for the [4 points](http://www.the4points.com/) (which looked awsome, thanks Dee).
