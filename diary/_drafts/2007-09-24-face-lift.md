title: Face Lift
---
Not since [January 4th 2006](http://www.roobottom.com/2006/01/04/new-year-re-design/) has there been any update, new look or (if you will) face lift to my own little corner of the web. So it was about bloody time I put mouse to slightly grubby desktop and upgraded things a little. Over the past few weeks, I've been spending quiet moments with Fireworks and then Dreamweaver slaving away to bring you a pimped-up roobottom. I've chopped out the things that were rubbish or no-body used (most notably the subscribe via email thing) and added in some cool new ways to navigate around. The Archives have received a complete re-code and now offer (I think) a great alternative to the standard Wordpress list by date feature. In-fact all of the code is sleeker, faster and more importantly ALL stored in it's theme directory - where as before it was scattered all over the place. I will endeavor to post some more technical details of what's going on behind the scenes in the near future - and I may even release some of the Archive code as a plug in (if I get enough spare time). Oh, and the flickr photo streams now work! Thanks to the brilliant work of [Eightface](http://eightface.com/wordpress/flickrrss/).
