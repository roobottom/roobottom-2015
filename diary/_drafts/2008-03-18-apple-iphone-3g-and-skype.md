title: 'Apple - iPhone, 3G and Skype.'
---
It was exciting news when apple [released details of the SDK for developing iPhone applications](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/iphoneroadmap/) last week. Watching the roadmap video I was very impressed with the direction that Apple have taken for rolling out the development of apps to third parties and distributing said apps in a brand new apps store. Of particular interest (aside from the accelerometer controlled games) was the AOL messenger. It got me thinking about the messenger system we use to remote-connect at work - [Skype](http://www.skype.com). With [rumours rife](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/29/3g-iphone-on-track-for-next-year/) around the whole subject of a G3 iPhone - and now the ability for third party developers to bring their apps to the worlds best mobile platform, it isn't a great stretch to suppose that they'll be skype for iPhone. Obviously, the 2.5G EDGE network that the UK iPhone currently uses wouldn't be enough to support VOIP calls - but with 3G support it's not unthinkable that iPhone users will be calling each other for free - Using their O2 unlimited data. I wait with bated breath to see what O2 (and by arbitration Apple) will do about this threat to their revenue. If [Apple's recent actions](http://www.roobottom.com/2008/01/15/apple-innovators-or-money-grabbers/) are anything to go by, there must surly be some kind of reaction to this.
