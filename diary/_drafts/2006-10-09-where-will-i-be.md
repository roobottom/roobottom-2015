title: Where Will I Be?
---
Next month sees a popular [sxsw](http://2007.sxsw.com/) event get it's UK premier in London. [20x2](http://www.20x2.org/) is 20 people given two minutes each to answer the same question, and I've taken the plunge and agreed to speak. So "where am I?"... To be honest I haven't got the first idea of what to say (or even if they'll understand the Brummy dribble that will fall from my mouth). I'm excited, but know it could be brown trousers time on the night. Maybe that's where i'll be... on the loo. If you're free on Sunday, 19th November and in the London area, come along to [Madame JoJo's](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?local=h&scale=10000&pc=W1F0SE&icon=x) at 7pm, should be a good night (at least the other guy's will be entertaining).
