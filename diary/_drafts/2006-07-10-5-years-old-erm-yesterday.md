title: 5 Years Old, erm, Yesterday!

according to the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.roobottom.com) roobottom dot com is 5 years old, erm, yesterday! Given my lack of posting lately, it's surprising I remembered at all, but being just a single day late is pretty good going I think. While we're on the subject of posting, give [Steve's Webcam](http://www.flickr.com/photos/steveswebcam) a look, you may at first glance think "this is just a webcam of a random back garden" and you'd probably be right, but if you're into piles of wood or indeed when he does get the archives working on the [offical site](http://steveswebcam.co.uk/) you can probably spot me getting out of the car at around 3.30pm yesterday (9th July)... Then you'll, you know, love it. OK, sorry, but that's it again for now. Why? Simply because I don't feel like writing much at the moment. I know I must be disappointing litterely tens of fans, but you guys will have to cope without me for a while. sorry.
