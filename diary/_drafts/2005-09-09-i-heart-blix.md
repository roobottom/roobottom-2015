title: I Heart Blix
---
I realise it's been entirely too long since I wrote a post that was remotely geeky (they've all been quite nerdy, but that's something entirely different). So the more observant of you my have realised the diary looking a little different. That's because I'm now using the very beautiful, very elegant [Blix](http://www.kingcosmonaut.de/blix/) theme for word press. I will do a proper rdc header when I get the chance, but until then, you can enjoy the diary working properly at long last.

Go check them out, if you know me and I've rudely shoved a camera in your face, I've probably even more rudely up-loaded them to the internet for all to see! That is all.
