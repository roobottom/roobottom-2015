In the first few weeks after our daughter was born I remember crying twice. The first time was immediately after she was born. I cried the cry of all new dads; overwhelmed by love and relief that your wife and child are OK. It was a happy cry.

The second cry wasn't happy at all. It was a cry of frustration, of wondering what the hell I'd done to deserve this torture. I was mourning the loss of my old life and the utter frustration of being totally at the mercy of this tiny dictator.

Believe me, I know how that sounds. It sounds like I'm the worst person in the world. We'd been blessed with a beautiful baby girl and all I could think about was how terrible I felt. 

To make matters worse, other dads didn't seem to feel this way. I'd awkwardly bring it up in conversations by saying things like "Those first few days are pretty tough, right?". They'd inevitably agree in some noncommittal way that certainly did nothing to convince me they'd ever felt the way I did.
