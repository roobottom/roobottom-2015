You may have seen these guys [Kissing Hank's Ass](http://www.roobottom.com/inc/livelinks.go.php?url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6632687078883055082). If not, have a watch, it's funny and well written (although, it does contain swearing, so if you don't like that sort of thing, don't watch). [![Check out these guys, they're kissing Hanks Rear End](http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/kissing_hanks_ass.jpg)](http://www.roobottom.com/inc/livelinks.go.php?url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6632687078883055082) The story is written by the [Rev J Huber](http://www.jhuger.com) an atheist with some pretty definite views on the whole idea of God. Reading his [FAQs](http://www.jhuger.com/about.php) you get the idea that this guy is not only very opinionated but also fiercley intelligent. So why then am I raving on about a video that obviously mocks what I believe? I'm writing about it because it matches exactly the attitude I had to the whole religious thing before I became a Christian. I can relate to the frustration that people feel that someone might believe in this God that doesn't make sense, He doesn't add up, and yet people still follow Him. I'm also writing about it because I think it's the impression that many people have of Christians today. We're the guys that stand on the street corner shouting the odds, prophesying hell fire and damnation. And it's true, some of us are. But I also think there are many more Christians that are out there, helping people, putting themselves in difficult and dangerous situations because they've dedicated their lives to making peace and following the ideals of Jesus. So yeah, the bible is important, and it is confusing, but the message of the new testament remains the same. Have a look at [Matthew 5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205;&version=31;), it pretty much sums up the whole idea for me.
