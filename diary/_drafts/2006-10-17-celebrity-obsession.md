title: Celebrity Obsession
---
Is it just me or has the world gone just that little bit madder? The past two morning's I've woken up to the usual radio wake-up call only to be greeted by stories of [Madona adopting a baby](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6054492.stm). Fair enough, I guess this may be news worthy, but the "top story" for two days in a row? It just all seems a little excessive, when, as Neil in our office put it...

> There's some ******* in North Korea building Nuclar weapons

 I guess it's the westerns worlds obsession with celebrity, but where does this come from? People traditionally are famous for being good at something (or [very bad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler)), but where does the obsession with [random people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Goody) "off the telly" come from? Appreciation of a person is, it seems, no longer related to their net-worth to society. What I am asking is this: Are we, as a society, dumbing down with our seemingly unending obsession with celebrity? Or is this just a phase we're going through, a bit like flop-wallpaper or clogs?
