Today I was reminded again of [1 Corinthians 13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2013&version=31), verses 4 - 7 especially.

> Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

 It never says it's easy, never an instant happily ever after, but always striving. Christian or not, I hope that these words are universally true.
