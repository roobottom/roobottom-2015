title: Back To Reality
---
Buzzzzz.... Oh crap, it's 7:59 and I'm feeling... well, like it's back to work after a week off. The weather is chilly, and even more so when I get into the office and discover that the heating hasn't been on and my fingers are freezing to the keyboard. My heart sinks as a torrent of 800-odd e-mails come flying in; In amongst the yule time spam there's clients demanding things done now now now and all I can think about is my warm bed. This is it then, back to reality. And that God! Thank God that I'm back at work, safe and well after a brilliant Christmas break. There's a whole new year ahead full of possibilities, full of promise, and hope. My heart maybe doesn't agree with my heads upbeat attitude, in fact it's very much feeling the anti-climax of the first day back at work and the stresses of the last few months. But with most things like this, if you set your mind against something, your heart inevitably catches up (that's the theory at least). It may be taking all my effort, but I'm actually looking forward to 2007, what have I got to complain about anyway? I'm almost afraid to write something like "time for a new start" it sounds so bitter, a little "yeah yeah yeah", but what the heck. Maybe it is time for a change of attitude. Maybe this is a one day wonder, but I really do hope not.
