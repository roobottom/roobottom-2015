The popcorn, the overpriced drinks, the sticky floor. But recently I've become a bit dishartend with the whole thing. I still like a good (or bad) film but something has been lacking in my cinema going experience. That was until Katie took me to the [Dome Cinema](http://www.domecinema.co.uk/) in Worthing. This place is what cinema's should be (what they used to be) and a LOT more fun than your local 100 screen mega-max. For a start there's a friendly atmosphere, the staff are obviously enjoy their jobs (or at least act like they do). And the whole place just feels different - if cinemas could have the x-factor then this one would have it in spades. Then there's the bar - and the fact you can take your drinks in with you. A Big BIG plus from our point of view. It just feels good to be in the building (no matter what film you're watching) - like you're having a real treat in an atmosphere of people who enjoy the same thing as you. You know what? This sterile corporate shit really isn't for me - we need more places like the Dome - it's what makes Britain great!
