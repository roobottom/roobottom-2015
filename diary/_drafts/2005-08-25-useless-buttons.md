title: Useless Buttons
---
Here it comes then, the first post for a month and it's about buttons? Yes, I could give you a whole host of deep and meaningful about life, the cosmos and everything but to be quite honest I've started to bore myself with the current stuff that's clogging up my head. So it's the buttons or nothing. 

The more observant of you will have noticed a whole host of buttons now at the top of the page. Where do they go? What do they do? I hear you cry, well let me tell you. 

A long time ago in a land far away there lived a race of tiny people, lets call them the Frits. The Frits spent all of their days frolicking in the fields by day and doing other such things by night. But one particular Frit was not satisfied with his lot in life, he didn't much care for the constant frolicking. 

So one day the little Frit set off, his most prised possessions in a little red sack upon his back. He walked up hill and over dale all the time carry his little red bag upon his back. Whenever he came to a turn in the road he would bend down, open the little red bag and leave a little red ribbon under a stone or tied around a branch. He did this so if he wanted to he could find his way back home. On he trekked, up hill and over dale all the time carrying his little red bag upon his back and leaving his ribbons under stones or tied around branches. Then one day he reached a clearing where a crocodile killed him and ate him all up. 

The end. 

So you see what I'm saying with this and the buttons? Sometimes its best not to know. I hope you enjoyed that waste of time.
