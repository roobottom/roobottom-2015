Yes, this is a complete geek post, so I apologize in advance. You may have noticed a few subtle changes around the place if you've been visiting lately. It was about time I had a clear out and a much needed tidy up. So many things were left unfinished or shoddily done that I needed one big blitz. The two biggest changes are the logo (and the associated subtle colour change) and the finalised footer (Kris: what competition, I don't remember any competition... Think I owe you a pint mate). Oh and changing from "roobottom dot com" to "roobottom", yeah, cos that "dot com" was so 2003. Ahem, anyway here is the full list of things I've changed, added or updated.

- The NEW logo!
- Ah, my footer, finished at last!
- Added a sign-up form for my E-mail Broadcasts, thanks to those nice people at [Zookoda](http://www.zookoda.com/)
- Added Google ads*
- a new [1 minute feedback](http://roobottom.wufoo.com/forms/roobottom-survey/) survey type affair
- the comments are now [coComment](http://www.cocomment.com/comments/roobottom) enabled
- I fixed the icon height problem
- I've added [feedburner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/roobottom) support
- I've update some of the link hovers to underlines rather than the background you couldn't see
- Gone are the cluttered icons in the top and left hand corners

 *Google ads: Only on the homepage, please support me if you feel the need. I usually get really made when people say stuff like this, so I've tried to keep them to a minimum. I've got a feeling I'm going to be needing all the money I can get soon. Maybe a post on this in the near future. Oh, and I'm aware of the problem with the links in the e-mail newsletter, I'm working on it!
