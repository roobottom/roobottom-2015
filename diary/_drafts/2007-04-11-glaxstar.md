I'm making a career move! After three happy years at [Trinity Design](http://www.trinitydesign.co.uk) I'm joining [Glaxstar](http://www.glaxstar.com) as thier web designer / interface person / possible tea maker, and I can't flippin wait! While this sees me not making my much anticipated move down south, it is the sort of opportunity I've been waiting for after Paul's had his [Ning Thing](http://lloydyweb.com/blog/2006/02/that_ning_thing.php) now it's time for a bit of Glaxstar action. There's some pretty big things in the pipeline so keep your eye on the website for the next few months as Glaxstar unleash their new "big thing" on the world. ;-)
