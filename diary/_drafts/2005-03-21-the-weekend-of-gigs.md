title: The Weekend of Gigs
---
Gigs, gigs, gigs! Well, two actually. Saturday me and Paul played a birthday party in Tamworth, and Sunday I did a couple of numbers at the Acoustic night at the Quality Hotel in Walsall. The best thing about playing places like that is you get to see some bloody good bands. I was blown away on Saturday with the quality of all the bands and performers, everyone was just fantasic. And of course Sunday night was the usual collection of brilliant performers.
