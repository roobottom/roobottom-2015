title: More Fun With Fuel
---
Yes, it's that time again folks! [Looks like](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4221296.stm) we're going have another fun-filled fuel blockade. I remember the last time this happened in 2000, fortunately I didn't have a car then, but a neighbour drove all the way to Dover then over into Calais to stock up on fuel! 

The government appears to be blaming some of the more recent increases on Hurricane Katrin which struck the US last week with devastating loss of life. While this could be true, we do pay an inordinate amount of duty on fuel in the UK compared to countries like America. Personally, I think that this is an inevitable part of the impending fuel crisis. What are we going to do as fuel gets more and more scarce? 

If you were in the government, wouldn't you be trying to squeeze every last penny out of the last drops of fuel? Supply and demand. We're never again going to see a time where we can waste fuel like we have in the past, its time for a change! I'm seriously considering trading in for a duel-fuel car. I love my high-powered, petrol guzzling machine, but I really do think enough is enough.
