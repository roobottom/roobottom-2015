I've been part of Team Firefly five years this month, and head of the design team for the last two. [Our story](http://fireflylearning.com/about-us/the-story) is unique; Joe & Simon wrote the first version of Firefly while still at school aged 16. Fast forward 14 years and we're now a 50-strong team with offices in London, Sydney and Brighton. 

This kind of growth brings with it challenges, especially as none of us knew how to run a successful business; we just had a product we believed in and an idea that it could really help busy teachers.

Over the years we've learned a lot. Sure we've had some great help along the way, but I really think our success is a testament to a strong vision, hard work and a constant willingness to learn.

Personally, I certainly didn't set out to be managing a team when I started, but the changing demands of the business means that I've had to adapt and learn, _a lot_. I wanted to write something to reflect on what I've learned. This isn't offered as tips for others (although if you do find it useful, I'm glad for it) but an exercise in firming in my mind exactly the values I wish to continue in, and help me jettison those I don't.

## Be humble, presume you're wrong
I must confess, this is something I really struggle with, but it's an idea that I really like. This doesn't mean you can never be right, but that your default standpoint should be to consider everyones opinions before you settle on a decision.

A practical example of this might be: You attend a meeting having prepared lots of work for a new software feature. You're utterly convinced that your solution is the best, after all you've thought about all the possibilities. The meeting doesn't go as you'd expect, and others propose different solutions you'd not considered. 

It's a this point you have two options: Press forward with convincing the group that your ideas are best; or be humble, presume you're wrong and try and find a solution that is better because it's the best parts of everyone's ideas.

## Talk to me, lets keep this relationship alive
Firefly run three-monthly reviews with team members completing a short survey beforehand. Giving people time to reflect on their role in a structured way is useful. From this we gain an insight into our team that we couldn't otherwise get. It also gives managers a chance to prepare for review meetings having read exactly how the team member thinks and feels. 

It's just one of a few ways we're adding improved communication 

## Hire those that are better at their jobs than you are
As a designer there's nothing worse than being hired to create only to find the client wants you as nothing more than a glorified paintbrush; specifying every brush stroke themselves. 

When you hire someone, they _should_ be able to do a whole lot you can't. And, perhaps more importantly, you should give them the freedom to do their thing. Sure there will things they'll have to do your way: patterns they must follow; or systems they must use; but you hired them to do a job, let them do it. 

They may not do things in the way you would, but that's OK. 

## Invest in your team
I've worked for companies that wouldn't spend any money on staff training unless it was specially relevant to their current role. More often than not, this meant they were left with skills they couldn't easily transfer.

Firefly have always offered each team member Â£1,000 per year training budget to spend how they wish. Well, within reason anyway, a holiday to the Bahamas isn't really a legitimate business expenditure. 

The point is that 

(look at Firefly's values).
