title: James Blunt & Kate Aumonier
---
Last Thursday we went to check out James Blunt at the Manchester Academy, which meant not only did I get to go to a gig (it's been a few months), But I also got to leave work 2 hours earlier - bonus. 

I've been listening to this guy's album for a couple of weeks, and had big expectations and man he didn't disappoint. Blunt has a real raw talent, and proved not every modern album rely's on expensive production techniques, I couldn't tell the difference between the live stuff and the polished album tracks. 

One song in particular that stuck out for me was 'No Bravery' which was my favourite from the album anyway, but absolutely awesome live. James was supported by Kate Aumonier whose set was superb enough for me to buy the CD. Strong vocals and cleverly written songs.
