title: Problems
---
I know, I know, I know! The updates have been getting less again - but I do have an excuse - [Work](http://glaxstar.com) has been mega busy, look out for some exciting stuff coming from them sometime soon.... But the lack of updates aren't the only problem with this site, one is the un-robustness of the design in our old friend Internet Explorer. [![roobottom on IE](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2209/2083175977_49c4cc09af.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2083175977/ "roobottom on IE by roobottom, on Flickr") I'm really inclined to say 'screw IE', but then again it's still a main-stay of web surfers the world over, it shouldn't be - but that's an argument for another time. Recently, my good friend Mr.Cotton told me that one of his classes had to review a website for an assignment, so being the good egg that he is they we're pointed in the direction of roobottom. Now, I like to think this was because Paul knows good design when he sees it, but its more likely that he just wanted to take the p**s out of my name. Knowing what our country's fine educational institutions are like at providing the latest equipment for their fine young minds, I doubt if they've got much choice than to use IE, but you never know some cleaver boffin may have sneaked in a copy of Firefox in his Transformers lunch box. So now I'm torn between *really* wanting to serve the readers who have little choice in their web software, and sticking it (in some small way) to the man. The man being, erm.. Well, I'm sure you know what I mean. Incidentally, Paul getting his class to review me did raise another issue that I *will* be sorting out - Comments. He said he didn't think most of the guys in his class even knew you could comment. Whoops! Is this true? Do it need to make it easier to and more obvious that you can comment? Anyway, all this blogging has made me hungry, and lunchtime is nearly over. TTFN.
