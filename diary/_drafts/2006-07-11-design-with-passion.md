Yesterday we launched the new [trinity website](http://www.trinitydesign.co.uk) (or at least the 90% complete version). Along with some new brochures this makes up the first wave of our long awaited re-brand.

Having now been in Kings Bromley for a little over a year, and with things going well for us, trinity design are ready to push our services to new customers. As far as the website goes, it's of course a mash up xhtml transitional, css, javascript and a LOT of image replacement. Rather than going for a full-blown technical site, we've opted for an extended version of the brochure, showing off our work in the print, marketing and web sectors fairly equally. There are plans in the pipeline for more dedicated web stuff, but for now I'm just pleased that we've finally got rid of the "pastures new" page. Anyway, feel free to take a look, and feedback is always welcome!
