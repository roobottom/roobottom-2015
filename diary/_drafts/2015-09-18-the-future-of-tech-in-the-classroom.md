title: The future of tech in the classroom
---
One of the things I spend a lot of time thinking about is education; or, more specifically the use of technology in education. I'm not a teacher, but I do work for a tech company whose goal it is to make education better.

Recently the <abbr title=" Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> released [a report](https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/frequent-use-school-computers-impairs-learning-finds-international) that suggeested that the use of technology in the classroom was having a detrimental effect on how well pupils were doing in standardised tests. As a company who really takes the time to try and understand education we certainly had a few thoughts on the report. In fact, one of Firefly's founders, Joe Mathewson, was invited onto the BBC to share his thoughts on the report. 

As one of the people responsible for a tool used by hundreds-of-thousands of student, teachers and parents every day I have a responsibility to think about how to make our apps genuinely useful. I'm also really interested in what comes next; what's the next big shift in technology that will redefine the classroom?

At the moment mobile is the disrupter of the status quo; Gone is the need for a dedicated computer lab, with tablets and phones now ubiquitous, computers have entered every part of the school day. 

Recently, Facebook brought Oculus Rift for $2billion. So why did they invest in a technology that seemed to have died on its arse in the mid 1980s? As Mark Zukerburg said in a press-call to announce the acquisition:

Of course, not everyone is thrilled about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus; some even suggesting that Zukerburg simply loved the device so he brought the company. However, its hard to ignore the vision, and its pretty clear what a difference VR could make to could make to the world beyond just games.

If VR is due to replace the screen, and change the way we interact with our environment, what does this mean for the classroom?

##Early adopters

* What will early adopters of this tech do in the classroom?
* What are the limitations of the current VR headsets, and how would this affect use in schools?
* What about the current attitude to tech in schools? How would people react to this?

An enterprising teacher could, if they wished and had enough time and money start using VR now. Oculus sell Developer kits so those with coding skills can build pretty much any experience they wish.

Imagine a Physics teacher explaining the structure of an atom to their students by immersing them in a world where she's able to zoom deep into the environment and show the students how the atoms of their desks are arranged.

If that sounds far fetched then have a look at [tomorrow project] this project that's helping school children build their own androids.

I imagine that some teachers and parents might see this as the ultimate nightmare senario for the classroom; rows of students, all wearing goggles, hooked into the schools mainframe. No one speaks as information is simply downloaded into the students brain.

Let me reassure you that what I'm suggesting here is something quite different. Unlike mobile devices which, by their nature, prevent real-world social interactions, Virtual Reality simply adds in another 

##Wider integration

* as gaming takes off, this will be an experience that kids are used to. Is there a point around them bringing this into the classroom?
* Seems all to be about presence. The feeling that you're _actually_ somewhere else is incredibly powerful. 

##Alternative technologies
* As LED technology improves, we'll start to see smart screens built into buildings themselves. The entire classroom could be a screen.
