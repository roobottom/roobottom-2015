title: Ouch, and other stories

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know it's been a while, but it's built up the expectation, right? Hmm, okay so maybe not. Since the last time I wrote, i've been doing all kinds of stuff (for want of a better word). So here's the rundown of two and a half weeks in the life of me... My last post was some random crap about an ice bar in london, so lets ignor that one and go back to the one before. 1 week before [Lee and Lindsay's wedding](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/395147/), and I was raving on about how old I felt. So the couples happy day came, Lee fluffed his lines, and Lloydy got VERY drunk. All in all a good day was had by all. The best bit being the hour rant that someone had in the loo, i'll post the video soon if he (or she, don't want to incriminate anyone.... although that would've meant I was filming in the girls bogs), will let me. Generally work... Actually, I'm not even going to bother with that one. The bank hoilday called for some [biking in the Wyre Valley](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/394848/) with the lads. What can I say, as usual a top day out, and got me some more footage for the "rant cam". I (and several others from church) took a visit to a mosque in Pleck for one of their open days. It's a really good idea, they open up the whole thing, show you round, feed you (yes, a BIG factor in deciding to go) and give you this talk on Islam. I'm impressed with anything that helps build bridges between communities, so a big thanks to those guys for making us feel so welcome. Another biking session brought me [this very nice wound](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/17616354/) and a couple of bruised ribs (hence the "ouch"). Which I guess brings me up to this week, that has so far conceited of work, a joint cell with the guys from [Eurostreams](http://www.eurostreams.co.uk) (an absolutely awesome night), the tuesday night pub quiz, and a bit of a bulti (init mate) with Steve, Paul, Ben and the rest of the guys from WCC. All that, plus the usual pub nights, cinema, the quiz and the odd jamming session here and there have made for a pretty sweet, 2 (or so) weeks. Interesting, eh? No... I didn't think so.
