[![The Mark](http://static.flickr.com/31/100373785_5e32845a6d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/100373785/ "Check out this photo on Flickr!") A strange mark appeared on my forehead on Tuesday. I went to the loo before lunch and checked myself out in the mirror (as you do) and it wasn't there, but when I returned from Lichfield the mark had materialized slap bang in the middle of my head. So what strange phenomenon caused this strange mark? I think I'm fairly safe as there's not even a single six anywhere in sight, but it's still a bit weird. Maybe it's cos my brain has been on full-tilt crazy go-nuts power for the last six weeks, and it's finally leaked. Who knows. Additional...
