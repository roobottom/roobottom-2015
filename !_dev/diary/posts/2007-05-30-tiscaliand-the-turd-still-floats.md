title: 'Tiscali&#8230; The Turd Still Floats'
---
Thanks to all who left a [comment](http://www.roobottom.com/2007/05/01/tiscali-the-turd-of-the-web/#comments) on my last Tiscali post, it seems that they've outdone themselves this time, here is a breif update: I sent a letter to Tiscali complains department aprising them of my situation and promptly... ahem... well, soonish recived a reply informing me that this was indeed a 'rare case' and I could expect the TAG removed from my line soon, as the nice woman who'd written the letter had issued an internal memo. So you can imagine my (lack of) surprise when I get a message from some woman at Tiscali saying 'we hope your internet is now working'... no no NO NO NO!!! So the TAG is still on my line, and to cap it all off, I'm now being chased by a dept collection agency because apparently I owe Tiscali money! Despite the fact they took the Direct Debit for a month of broadband they didn't provide. Anyway, I've written them another polite letter and OffCom are involved. My advice? If you have Tiscali, get rid (if you can) get rid now.
