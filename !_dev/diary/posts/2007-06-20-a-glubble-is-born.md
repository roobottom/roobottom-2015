title: A Glubble Is Born

[![Glubble Is Here!](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1097/569296502_ae9fa8e9cf.jpg)](http://www.glubble.com "Visit Glubble.com") As some of you know, I moved jobs recently to work for the Birmingham based [Glaxstar](http://www.glaxstar.com) as their in-house web / UI guy, and I have my first major bit of news... [Glubble](http://www.glubble.com) is born! Glubble is a extension for [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com) aimed at children under 12, and aims to provide a fun, safe browsing environment for them. It comes with around 350 sites (in what we call the [Glubble World](http://www.glubbleworld.com)) that have been pre-vetted as safe and just downright cool for kids. The parents and extended family and friends ('helpers') can then add sites to the childs Glubble. And vise-verse, If a child clicks on a link they're not allowed to see, they can ask a 'helper' for permission. So Glubble is infinitely extensible, and very personal to a particular family, group, school, whatever! There's a new <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> for kids too! It includes a thumbnail bar so kids can easily view and click on their bookmarks. It even screenshots new sites that are bookmarked for easy of finding later. It's a shared experience too, and it's easy to add other kids or helpers into your Glubble. They then can request from the new helpers and the helpers can add sites for their new Glubble children! ## And the Reaction?

 The whole team, especially those currently in the USA have worked their proverbial socks off, and many a late night has been spent hunched over a laptop screen to get this launched on time. I for one am very proud and privileged to work with such a bunch of hardworking, driven people. The reaction from users and tech-heads around the net has been somewhat mixed. I'm pleased to say that we managed over [1000 downloads](http://blog.glubble.com/?p=13) in the first 24-hours. The product has had mentions and reviews galore, not least by such shining lights as [The Washington Post](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/06/glubble_the_web_in_a_kidfriend_1.html), [Wired](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/06/glubble_the_kid.html), [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/software/featured-firefox-extension/approve-sites-your-kid-visits-with-glubble-270139.php), [CNET](http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9731277-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1001_3-0-5) and [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/18/glubble-makes-firefox-family-friendly/)... (to name but a few). But don't take their word for it, why not just bing-bash-bosh download yourself a copy from [glubble.com](http://www.glubble.com) and try it for yourself. Just remember, you need [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com) to run it, but that's ok, Firefox is probably better than your average web-browser anyway. - Jon.
