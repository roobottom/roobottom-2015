title: Happy Go Lucky Review

![hapy-go-lucky.png](http://wp.roodesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hapy-go-lucky.png) Apparently the Times called this film "Delightful", and "4 stars" says the Daily Mirror. In fact, this films seems to have received rave reviews from critics across the bored. So it was with some confidence that Katie and I rented Mike Leigh's latest offering last night. The only accolade I can think of to give this bore feast of a film is that it holds the record for putting Katie to sleep in the least time possible, I think she lasted 2.65 seconds. Sally Hawkins was the only saving grace in the "feel good" picture, I hope she goes on to better things than this. I'd love to give you a run down of the plot, or at least the basic premise, but there really was none. Follow any 30-something Londoner around for a week, observing them at even the most mundane task and you'll have an experience a lot like Happy Go Lucky. About 45 min in I took to forwarding through the chapters on the DVD to see if it would eventually go somewhere - it didn't. Thank goodness I didn't waste my time on it. I feel sorry for the people who sat though it (trapped like rats on a sinking ship) at the cinema. My advice is avoid this film at all costs. 0/10.
